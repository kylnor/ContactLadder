## QUESTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION

1. **Scope Decision**: Should we create comprehensive Deep Dives for each topic, or shorter "Quick Guide" modules for some?

2. **Target Audience**: Are we focused on individual agents (Tier 1-2) or also team leaders/brokers (Tier 3)?

3. **Integration Priority**: Which integrations beyond ActivePipe and RealScout are most used by your audience?
   - Zillow (lead gen)?
   - dotloop (transaction management)?
   - SkySlope (transaction management)?
   - Spacio (open house leads)?

4. **Mobile vs. Desktop**: Should Mobile Workflows be woven into existing modules or a standalone course?

5. **Analytics Depth**: Basic reporting (pipeline counts) or advanced (conversion funnels, ROI analysis)?

## ESTIMATED CONTENT CREATION EFFORT

|-------|------|---------------------|----------|

| Settings & Preferences | Mini-guide | 2-3 hours | LOW |

**Total for Phase 1-2 (Recommended)**: 20-30 hours of content creation

## GAPS IN EXISTING CONTENT TO ADDRESS

While reviewing, I noticed these minor gaps in existing modules:

1. **Essentials Module 4 (Complete the Contact)**: Should mention Custom Fields as "Advanced" placeholder
2. **Advanced Module A2 (Mail Merge)**: Should cover email open/click tracking in more detail
3. **Deep Dive 1 (Properties)**: Should expand Matching Engine (currently mentioned briefly)
4. **Deep Dive 2 (Task Lists)**: Should add recurring tasks/reminders
5. **Deep Dive 3 (Templates)**: Should add Call Scripts and Text Templates sections
6. **Deep Dive 4 (AI Mastery)**: Should add Smart Suggestions module
7. **Deep Dive 5 (Teams)**: Should add shared inbox management

---

## NEXT STEPS

**Option 1: Comprehensive Approach**
- Create all Tier 1 topics as full modules
- Estimated timeline: 4-6 weeks for Phase 1-2
- Result: Complete training platform covering 95% of Cloze features

**Option 2: Targeted Approach**
- Focus on top 5 most-requested topics based on user feedback
- Create as mini-modules (10-15 min each)
- Estimated timeline: 2-3 weeks
- Result: Quick wins addressing immediate gaps

**Option 3: Integration-First Approach**
- Prioritize Connections Hub expansion (Zillow, dotloop, SkySlope, Spacio)
- Add Import/Export and Mobile Workflows
- Estimated timeline: 2-3 weeks
- Result: Better onboarding and tool connectivity

**Recommendation**: Start with **Option 2** (targeted approach) focusing on:
1. Import/Export (onboarding blocker)
2. Notes & Activity (daily use)
3. Mobile Workflows (agents work on the go)
4. Custom Fields (power user request)
5. Email Tracking (immediate ROI visibility)

Then assess user engagement and expand based on analytics/feedback.
