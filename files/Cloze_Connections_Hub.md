# CLOZE CONNECTIONS HUB - Training Outline

## howtoCloze.com / contactladder.com

---

## OVERVIEW

**Goal:** Get all your tools talking to Cloze.

**Note:** The "Big Three" connections (Email, Phone, Calendar) are covered in Essentials Module 0. The Connections Hub is for additional integrations that extend Cloze's functionality.

**Who This Is For:** Agents who use additional tools like ActivePipe, RealScout, Canva, DocuSign, or other real estate and business apps and want them to work seamlessly with Cloze.

**The Promise:**

> "You already have tools you love. ActivePipe for your newsletters. RealScout for buyer searches. DocuSign for signatures. The Connections Hub brings them all together so information flows automatically—no double entry, no switching between apps, no forgetting to update something."

---

## PREREQUISITE: NINJA SELLING VIEW SETUP

**Important:** Before connecting any integrations, ensure your Cloze account is set to the Ninja Selling view. This is critical for seeing the Contact Ladder segments (Network, Fan, Advocate) and real estate-specific features.

### Setting Your View to Ninja Selling

**WHY This Matters:**

The Ninja Selling view configures Cloze to work specifically with the Contact Ladder system and real estate workflows. Without this view enabled:
- You won't see Network, Fan, and Advocate segments
- Integrations may not sync the correct segment data
- Templates and workflows won't match the training

**HOW to Set It:**

1. Go to Settings → View
2. Select "Ninja Selling" from the dropdown
3. Confirm the change

**Verification:** Open any contact and check the Segment dropdown. You should see: SOI, Network, Fan, Advocate, Buyer, Seller, and other Contact Ladder options.

**Note:** This is a one-time setup. If you're already in Ninja Selling view (segments show correctly), you're all set and can proceed to the integrations below.

## INTEGRATION 1: ACTIVEPIPE

### Connect Your Email Marketing Platform

**WHY (Video - 1-2 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Using ActivePipe, not connected | "You're organizing contacts in Cloze, then manually rebuilding lists in ActivePipe. Connect them once and your Cloze segments sync automatically." |
| B | Thinking about email marketing | "ActivePipe is built for newsletters to hundreds of people. Cloze is built for personal relationships. Together, they're perfect - organize in Cloze, market at scale with ActivePipe." |
| C | Frustrated by double-entry | "Every time you tag someone #investor in Cloze, that should automatically update in ActivePipe. It can. That's what this integration does." |

**Story to include:**

> "I used to export contacts from Cloze, import to ActivePipe, then manually update their segments. When someone moved from Buyer to Past Client, I'd have to update it in two places. The integration eliminated that. Now I organize once in Cloze—segments, stages, tags—and it syncs to ActivePipe automatically."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**What the ActivePipe Integration Does:**

The ActivePipe integration creates a two-way sync between Cloze and ActivePipe:

| Direction | What Syncs | Why It Matters |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Cloze → ActivePipe** | Contact segments (Buyer/Seller/etc.), Stages (Lead/Warm/Hot), Tags, Next Steps, Do Not Contact status | Your organization in Cloze becomes your audience targeting in ActivePipe - no manual list building |
| **ActivePipe → Cloze** | Campaign sends, Email opens, Link clicks, Unsubscribe info | You see your ActivePipe activity on each contact's timeline in Cloze - complete relationship history |

**Key Insight:**

> "Organize once in Cloze, communicate at scale with ActivePipe. The integration is the bridge that makes it seamless."

**When to Use ActivePipe vs. Cloze Mail Merge:**

| Use Case | Tool | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| Personal email to <500 people | Cloze Mail Merge | Looks like individual emails from your inbox |
| Newsletter to 500+ contacts | ActivePipe | Built for mass email with beautiful templates |
| Branded marketing campaigns | ActivePipe | Professional design, analytics, automation |
| "Just checking in" to 30 buyers | Cloze Mail Merge | Personal touch, direct replies |

**HOW (Video - 3-4 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

1. Contact ActivePipe support (support@activepipe.com) to enable Cloze for your account
2. In Cloze: More → Settings → Connected Accounts
3. Scroll to Business Apps section
4. Click "Connect ActivePipe"
5. Enter your ActivePipe credentials
6. Authorize the connection
7. Show the initial sync starting (may take several minutes for first sync)
8. Navigate to a contact in Cloze
9. Show how to view ActivePipe campaign activity in the timeline
10. Show how segment changes in Cloze automatically sync to ActivePipe

**Important Setup Note:**

> "Only ONE Cloze account can connect to an ActivePipe account. If you're on a team, decide who 'owns' the connection. Contacts must have email addresses in Cloze to sync to ActivePipe."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if I have contacts in ActivePipe that aren't in Cloze?"
  - A: They won't sync back to Cloze automatically. The integration syncs Cloze contacts TO ActivePipe, not the other way. You'll want to ensure your primary contact database is in Cloze first.

- Q: "What if someone has multiple email addresses in Cloze?"
  - A: The integration uses their "preferred" email address. Set this in Cloze by marking one email as preferred.

- Q: "What if I change a segment in Cloze - how long until it updates in ActivePipe?"
  - A: Syncs happen every few hours. Changes aren't instant, but typically update within 2-4 hours.

- Q: "What if someone unsubscribes from ActivePipe?"
  - A: The unsubscribe information syncs back to Cloze, and you'll see it on their timeline. They won't receive future ActivePipe campaigns from you.

- Q: "Can I see who opened my ActivePipe emails in Cloze?"
  - A: Yes! Open and click activity from ActivePipe campaigns appears on each contact's timeline in Cloze.

## INTEGRATION 2: REALSCOUT

### Track Your Buyers' Property Searches

**WHY (Video - 1-2 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Using RealScout, not connected | "Your buyers are saving homes in RealScout, but you're tracking conversations in Cloze. Connect them and see everything in one timeline." |
| B | Wants better buyer insights | "Wouldn't it be great to see exactly which properties your buyer viewed, when they viewed them, and what they saved—right alongside your emails and calls? That's what this integration does." |
| C | Frustrated by scattered info | "You're switching between RealScout to see their activity and Cloze to see your conversations. Stop switching. Connect them." |

**Story to include:**

> "I had a buyer I hadn't heard from in two weeks. I checked RealScout and saw she'd been super active—viewing 15 homes in Henderson. With the integration, I would have seen that activity in Cloze automatically and called her that same day. Instead, I missed the timing and she went with another agent."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**What the RealScout Integration Does:**

RealScout syncs your buyer activity from RealScout into Cloze's timeline:

| What Syncs | What You See in Cloze | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Saved Listings** | Which properties they saved, when | Know what they're interested in |
| **Viewed Listings** | Which properties they viewed | See their search patterns |
| **Email Alerts** | What searches they set up | Understand their criteria |
| **RealScout Activity** | Full timeline of property engagement | Combined with your calls/emails/meetings for complete picture |

**Key Insight:**

> "RealScout shows you what your buyers WANT. Cloze shows you your relationship with them. Together, you see the complete story—their interests AND your conversations—in one place."

**The Power of a Unified Timeline:**

Before a call with a buyer, you can see:
- Last 3 properties they saved
- When they viewed them
- Your last email exchange
- Your last phone call
- Their current search criteria

All in one view. You're never caught off guard.

**HOW (Video - 3-4 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

1. In Cloze: More → Settings → Connected Accounts
2. Scroll to Real Estate Apps section
3. Click "Connect RealScout"
4. Enter your RealScout credentials
5. Authorize the connection
6. Show the initial sync starting
7. Navigate to a buyer contact in Cloze
8. Show RealScout activity appearing in the timeline:
   - Saved listings with property photos
   - Viewed listings
   - Email alert activity
9. Show how to click through to view the property details
10. Demonstrate how this activity appears alongside emails and calls

**Pro Tip:**

> "Before your buyer consultation call, pull up their Cloze record. Scroll the timeline. You'll see every property they've looked at. Reference one casually in conversation: 'I saw you saved that home on Crystal Springs—did you want to see it?' They'll think you're incredibly attentive. You just checked Cloze."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if my buyer uses RealScout but I don't see their activity in Cloze?"
  - A: Make sure the email address in Cloze matches the email they used to sign up for RealScout. The integration matches on email address.

- Q: "What if I have multiple buyers—will I see all their activity?"
  - A: Yes, as long as each buyer's contact record in Cloze has their correct email address. Each buyer's activity appears on their individual timeline.

- Q: "What if they view a property but don't save it?"
  - A: RealScout tracks both views and saves. You'll see both types of activity in Cloze.

- Q: "Can I turn off RealScout activity for certain contacts?"
  - A: You can disconnect the integration entirely, but there's no per-contact filtering. If you want to see it for some buyers, you'll see it for all who use RealScout.

- Q: "What if they stop using RealScout?"
  - A: Their historical activity remains in Cloze (it doesn't delete). You just won't see new activity once they stop using RealScout.

## INTEGRATION 3: CANVA

### Create Marketing Materials with AI

**WHY (Video - 1-2 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Creates flyers manually | "You're typing property details into Canva every time you get a listing. Connect it to Cloze and MAIA pulls the details automatically." |
| B | Wants faster marketing | "From listing to flyer in 60 seconds. That's what happens when MAIA can push your Cloze property data directly into Canva templates." |
| C | Doesn't use Canva yet | "Canva is the easiest way to create beautiful marketing materials. With the Cloze integration, it's even easier—your property details auto-fill the design." |

**Story to include:**

> "I used to spend 20 minutes per listing creating a flyer—pulling up the MLS, typing in the price, beds, baths, features, resizing photos. With Canva connected to Cloze, I ask MAIA 'create a flyer for 123 Main Street' and she pushes all the details into a Canva template. I tweak colors, hit download, done. 20 minutes became 2."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**What the Canva Integration Does:**

The Canva integration lets MAIA (Cloze AI) create marketing materials using your Cloze data:

| What You Can Create | How It Works | Time Saved |
|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| **Listing Flyers** | MAIA pulls property details from Cloze Properties → Creates Canva design → You customize and download | 15-20 min per flyer |
| **Social Posts** | MAIA generates template with property info | 10 min per post |
| **Open House Signs** | Auto-fills address, date, time, your info | 5 min per sign |
| **Just Listed/Sold Cards** | Pulls from Cloze Properties → Generates design | 10 min per card |

**Key Insight:**

> "MAIA knows your properties, your contact info, your branding preferences. Canva has beautiful templates. The integration connects them so you stop manually typing information that already exists."

**Requirements:**

- Cloze Platinum or above (for MAIA features)
- Free or paid Canva account
- Property information entered in Cloze Properties tab

**HOW (Video - 3-4 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

1. In Cloze: More → Settings → Connected Accounts
2. Scroll to Design & Marketing section
3. Click "Connect Canva"
4. Authorize Cloze to access your Canva account
5. Show the connection confirmation
6. Navigate to a property in Cloze Properties tab
7. Tap the MAIA icon (sparkle ✨)
8. Say or type: "Create a listing flyer for this property in Canva"
9. Show MAIA generating the Canva design
10. Show the design opening in Canva with property details pre-filled
11. Demonstrate quick customizations (colors, fonts, photos)
12. Download and show the final flyer

**Alternative Approach - Ask MAIA Directly:**

> "You can also just ask MAIA: 'Create a Canva flyer for 123 Main Street' from anywhere in Cloze. As long as that property exists in your Properties tab, MAIA will find it and create the design."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if I don't have a Canva account?"
  - A: Create a free one at canva.com. The free version works with this integration, though Canva Pro gives you more templates and features.

- Q: "What if the property details are wrong in the Canva design?"
  - A: The integration pulls from your Cloze Properties record. Fix the info in Cloze, then regenerate the design.

- Q: "What if I want to use my own Canva templates?"
  - A: MAIA uses Canva's real estate templates by default. You can manually copy info from Cloze into your own templates, but the AI generation uses standard templates.

- Q: "Can MAIA create designs for things other than properties?"
  - A: The Canva integration is primarily designed for property marketing. For other designs, you'd create them in Canva directly (not via MAIA).

- Q: "What if I want to customize the design before downloading?"
  - A: You can! MAIA creates the initial design, then it opens in Canva where you have full editing control. Change anything you want before downloading.

## ZAPIER: CONNECT ANYTHING

### Automate Workflows Between Cloze and 5,000+ Apps

**WHY Zapier?**

> "If Cloze doesn't have a direct integration for a tool you use, Zapier probably does. It connects Cloze to thousands of apps without writing code."

**What Is Zapier?**

Zapier is an automation platform that connects apps and creates workflows called "Zaps."

**Example Zaps for Real Estate:**

| Trigger | Action | Benefit |
|---------|--------|---------|
| New contact added to Cloze | Create row in Google Sheets | Backup contacts to spreadsheet |
| Stage changed to "Hot Buyer" | Send notification to Slack | Alert team about hot leads |
| Contact tagged #newlisting | Add to Facebook Custom Audience | Target ads to interested buyers |
| Cloze reminder created | Add task to Asana/Trello | Sync task management |

**HOW to Connect Zapier:**

1. Create a free Zapier account at zapier.com
2. Search for Cloze in the Zapier app directory
3. Choose a pre-built Zap or create a custom one
4. Authorize Cloze to connect with Zapier
5. Configure trigger and action
6. Test and activate

**Note:** Zapier requires a separate account. Some Zaps require a paid Zapier plan depending on complexity.

## TROUBLESHOOTING CONNECTIONS

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Connection Won't Authorize:**
- Make sure you're using the correct login credentials for the app
- Check if you have admin permissions (some integrations require account admin access)
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting
- Clear browser cache and try again

**Data Not Syncing:**
- Check that sync is enabled in Connected Accounts settings
- Verify the account connection is still active (green checkmark)
- Initial syncs can take up to several hours for large datasets
- Ongoing syncs typically happen every 2-4 hours, not instantly

**Duplicate Contacts Appearing:**
- Cloze attempts to merge duplicates automatically
- Manually merge duplicates: open contact → More → Merge
- Check contactsmith.com for advanced duplicate cleaning

**Integration Showing "Disconnected":**
- Reconnect by clicking the integration and re-authorizing
- This can happen if you change your password on the connected app
- Some integrations require periodic re-authorization for security

**Activity Not Appearing on Timeline:**
- Verify the contact's email address matches across both platforms
- Check integration settings - some apps let you choose what syncs
- Historical activity may not sync - only new activity after connection

**Can't Find an Integration:**
- Not all integrations are available on all Cloze plans
- Some integrations require specific Cloze plan levels (Platinum, etc.)
- Check if the app is supported: More → Settings → Connected Accounts

---

## MANAGING YOUR CONNECTIONS

### Best Practices for Connected Accounts

**Review Connections Regularly:**
- Every 3-6 months, audit your connected accounts
- Disconnect apps you no longer use
- Reconnect any that show "Disconnected" status

**Be Strategic About What You Connect:**
- More connections = more data on timelines
- Only connect apps you actively use
- Too many connections can create timeline clutter

**Understand Sync Limitations:**
- Most integrations sync NEW activity only (not historical)
- Syncs happen every few hours, not real-time
- Some integrations are one-way (Cloze → App or App → Cloze)

**Security Considerations:**
- Connecting an app gives it access to relevant Cloze data
- Review permissions when authorizing
- Disconnect integrations if you stop using the service
- Use strong, unique passwords for all connected accounts

**Team Considerations:**
- Some integrations allow only one Cloze account to connect (e.g., ActivePipe)
- Coordinate with your team before connecting shared tools
- Consider who "owns" the integration connection
