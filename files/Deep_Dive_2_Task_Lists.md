## DEEP DIVE OVERVIEW

**Goal:** Master Next Steps and Task Lists to create custom buyer/seller workflows that move clients through your process automatically.

**Who This Is For:** Agents who want to customize and automate their buyer consultation process, listing presentation workflow, transaction checklists, and post-close follow-up sequences.

**Prerequisites:**
- Completed Cloze Essentials (or actively using Segments and Stages)
- Understanding of your current buyer/seller process

**Time to Complete:** 30-45 minutes

**The Promise:**

> "Stop forgetting steps in your buyer consultations. Stop missing follow-ups with sellers. Task Lists turn your best process into a repeatable checklist that Cloze reminds you to complete. Build it once, use it forever, never drop the ball again."

## MODULE T1: UNDERSTANDING NEXT STEPS

### Your Workflow, Automated

**WHY (Video - 3-4 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Inconsistent process | "You handle each buyer differently. Sometimes you remember to send the buyer guide. Sometimes you forget. Next Steps make your process consistent every single time." |
| B | Overwhelmed by tasks | "You've got 8 buyers, 3 listings, 2 deals in contract. You can't remember where each one is in your process. Next Steps show you exactly what to do next for each client." |
| C | Wants to scale | "You can only handle so many clients because you're tracking everything in your head. Next Steps let you handle twice as many clients without dropping the ball." |

**Story to include:**

> "I used to have a buyer consultation process I loved—send the buyer guide, schedule the consultation, review their pre-approval, send them my lender referrals, schedule showings. I did it perfectly for the first buyer. By the time I had 5 buyers, I'd forget steps. One buyer never got my lender list. Another didn't get the buyer guide. Next Steps turned my process into a checklist. Now every buyer gets the exact same VIP experience, and I don't have to remember anything."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**What Are Next Steps?**

Next Steps are **repeatable checklists** that follow your workflow and help move clients through each Stage. They track:
- What tasks have been completed
- What tasks are pending
- What needs to happen next
- When reminders should fire

**Next Steps vs. To-Do Lists:**

| Feature | Regular To-Do List | Next Steps in Cloze |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Repeatable** | No—manual every time | Yes—templates for each Segment |
| **Auto-Advance** | No—you pick next task | Yes (Process style) or Manual (Task List style) |
| **Linked to Contacts** | Tasks are separate from people | Every Next Step is attached to a contact |
| **Reminders** | Manual | Automatic based on due dates |
| **Templates** | No | Yes—customize per Segment |

**The Two Styles: Process vs. Task List**

| Style | How It Works | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Process** | Steps advance automatically in order. Mark Step 1 done → Step 2 becomes active. Sequential, enforced order. | Linear workflows where steps must happen in sequence (8x8 program, listing presentation) |
| **Task List** | Mark steps done in any order. Manually pick which step is next. Flexible, non-linear. | Flexible workflows where order varies (buyer showings, ongoing client management) |
| **Mixed** | Some steps auto-advance, some are flexible | Most real-world workflows |

**Key Insight:**

> "Process style = 'Do this, then this, then this.' Task List style = 'Here's everything that needs to happen, do them in whatever order makes sense.' Most agents use Process for structured workflows (8x8, listing prep) and Task List for ongoing relationships (Hot Buyers, Advocates)."

**HOW Next Steps Appear in Cloze (Video - 2 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

1. Open a contact with active Next Steps
2. Show the Next Steps section on their contact page:
   - ✅ Step 1: Send buyer guide (completed)
   - ✅ Step 2: Schedule consultation (completed)
   - 🔵 Step 3: Review pre-approval (active/current)
   - ⚪ Step 4: Send lender referrals (pending)
   - ⚪ Step 5: Schedule first showing (pending)
3. Show how the current step appears in your Agenda:
   - "Sarah Martinez - Review pre-approval (due today)"
4. Show how to mark a step complete:
   - Tap the checkbox or "Mark Complete"
   - (Process style) Next step automatically becomes active
   - (Task List style) Manually select next step
5. Show the timeline entry when a step completes:
   - "Next Step completed: Review pre-approval"

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What's the difference between Next Steps and the Keep in Touch reminders?"
  - A: Keep in Touch reminds you to stay in touch based on time since last contact. Next Steps are specific tasks in your workflow. Both appear in your Agenda.

- Q: "Can I have multiple Next Step sequences running for the same contact?"
  - A: No—each contact has ONE active Next Step sequence based on their Segment. If you change their Segment, you can switch to a different Next Step template.

- Q: "What if I need to skip a step?"
  - A: Mark it complete even if you didn't do it, or delete the step. Process style requires completing steps to advance, so skipping = marking done.

- Q: "Can I see all my active Next Steps across all contacts?"
  - A: Yes—your Agenda shows all Next Steps due today or overdue. You can also filter in People to see everyone with active Next Steps.

## MODULE T2: PROCESS STYLE WORKFLOWS

### Sequential Steps That Auto-Advance

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Wants structure | "Process style is perfect when your workflow has a specific order. Step 1 must happen before Step 2. Like the 8x8 program—you can't do Touch 3 before Touch 1." |
| B | Trains new agents | "New agent: 'What do I do next with this lead?' You: 'Just look at Cloze. It tells you.' Process style guides them through your exact system." |
| C | Wants accountability | "Process style won't let you skip steps. If you try to jump to Step 5, it says 'Nope, finish Step 3 first.' Great for making sure nothing gets missed." |

**Story to include:**

> "I hired a new buyer agent and needed to train her on our buyer consultation process. Instead of writing out instructions, I built it as a Process-style Next Steps template. Now when she gets a new buyer lead, Cloze tells her exactly what to do: Step 1 - Send intro email. Step 2 - Schedule call. Step 3 - Send buyer guide. She marks each one complete and the next step appears. Training done."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**How Process Style Works:**

```
Step 1: Send intro email
   ↓ (mark complete)
Step 2: Schedule buyer consultation
   ↓ (mark complete)
Step 3: Send buyer guide PDF
   ↓ (mark complete)
Step 4: Conduct buyer consultation
   ↓ (mark complete)
Step 5: Review pre-approval
   ↓ (mark complete)
Step 6: Send lender referrals
   ↓ (mark complete)
Step 7: Schedule first showing
```

**When a step is marked complete:**
- That step shows ✅ Completed
- The NEXT step automatically becomes active 🔵
- Reminder fires for the new active step
- You can't skip ahead without marking steps done

**Perfect Use Cases for Process Style:**

| Workflow | Why Process Works |
|----------|------------------|
| **8x8 Program** | 8 touches in 8 weeks, must happen in order |
| **Listing Presentation Prep** | Research → CMA → Presentation → Contract, sequential |
| **New Lead Nurture** | Intro → Guide → Consultation → Qualify, step-by-step |
| **Onboarding Sequence** | Welcome → Setup → Training → Go Live, linear |

**HOW to Create a Process-Style Workflow (Video - 4-5 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

**Example: Buyer Lead Process**

1. Go to More → Settings → People and Companies
2. Find the Segment you want to customize (e.g., "Buyer")
3. Tap the gear icon ⚙️ next to Buyer
4. Select "Next Steps"
5. Choose "Process" style
6. Click "+ Add Step" and create your workflow:

**Step 1: Send intro email**
   - Reminder: Immediately when Segment is set
   - Link template: "Buyer Intro Email"

**Step 2: Schedule buyer consultation**
   - Reminder: 1 day after Step 1
   - Note: "Use Calendly link or call to schedule"

**Step 3: Send buyer guide PDF**
   - Reminder: When Step 2 is marked complete
   - Link template: "Buyer Guide Email"

**Step 4: Conduct buyer consultation**
   - Reminder: On the scheduled consultation date
   - Link template: "Buyer Consultation Agenda"

**Step 5: Review pre-approval letter**
   - Reminder: 1 day after consultation
   - Note: "If no pre-approval, send to preferred lender"

**Step 6: Send lender referrals**
   - Reminder: Only if needed
   - Link template: "Lender Referral Email"

**Step 7: Schedule first property showing**
   - Reminder: 3 days after pre-approval reviewed
   - Note: "Create buyer profile and send property matches"

7. Set reminder timing for each step:
   - "Immediately"
   - "1 day after previous step"
   - "3 days after previous step"
   - "On specific date" (if you set due dates manually)

8. Link email templates to steps (if you've created them in Library)

9. Save the Next Steps template

10. Show how it works:
    - Create a new contact: "John Smith"
    - Set Segment to "Buyer"
    - Next Steps auto-populate with Step 1 active
    - Agenda shows: "Send intro email to John Smith"
    - Mark Step 1 complete
    - Step 2 automatically becomes active

**Pro Tip:**

> "Link email templates to steps so you don't have to remember what to send. When Step 3 says 'Send buyer guide PDF,' clicking the template loads the pre-written email. Edit, send, mark complete."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if I need to go back and redo a step?"
  - A: You can't "un-complete" a step in Process style without manually editing the sequence. If you need to redo something, add a note or create a one-off task.

- Q: "What if Steps 3 and 4 can happen in either order?"
  - A: Use Task List style (Module T3) or Mixed style. Process enforces strict order.

- Q: "What if the buyer doesn't respond and I'm stuck on Step 2 for weeks?"
  - A: That's fine—the step stays active until you mark it complete or move the buyer to a different Segment (e.g., "Lost" or "Cold Lead").

- Q: "Can I have different Process sequences for different buyer types (first-time vs. investor)?"
  - A: Yes—create Sub-Segments or use tags, then build different Next Step templates for each. Or use one template and add optional steps.

- Q: "What if I want some steps to auto-advance and others to be flexible?"
  - A: Use Mixed style—some steps are Process (auto-advance), some are Task List (manual advance).

## MODULE T3: TASK LIST STYLE WORKFLOWS

### Flexible Checklists, Any Order

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Non-linear workflows | "Your Hot Buyers don't follow a script. Sometimes they want to see homes first, then get pre-approved. Sometimes it's the opposite. Task List style lets you adapt to their pace." |
| B | Wants control | "Process style is too rigid—you want to decide what's next based on the situation. Task List gives you a checklist and lets YOU pick the order." |
| C | Managing ongoing relationships | "Advocates don't have a 'Step 1, Step 2' process. You do VIP touches as opportunities arise. Task List style shows you all the options, you pick what makes sense now." |

**Story to include:**

> "I have a Hot Buyer segment for active buyers ready to purchase in 30-60 days. Some buyers want to see homes immediately. Others want to nail down financing first. I can't force a Process because everyone's different. Task List style gives me a menu of tasks—review pre-approval, send property matches, schedule showings, check in on timeline—and I mark them complete in whatever order the buyer's journey takes. Flexible, but nothing gets forgotten."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**How Task List Style Works:**

All steps are visible at once. You can complete them in any order. You manually pick which step is "next" (active).

**Example: Hot Buyer Task List**

- ⚪ Review pre-approval letter
- ⚪ Send property matches based on criteria
- ⚪ Schedule property showings
- ⚪ Follow up after showings
- ⚪ Check in on timeline (how soon are they buying?)
- ⚪ Send market update
- ⚪ Refer to lender (if needed)
- ⚪ Prepare offer when ready

You pick which one to activate first:
- Buyer A: Start with "Review pre-approval"
- Buyer B: Start with "Send property matches" because they're already pre-approved

Mark them complete in whatever order makes sense. Manually select the next active task.

**Task List vs. Process:**

| Scenario | Process | Task List |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **8x8 Program** | ✅ Perfect—must be sequential | ❌ Too rigid |
| **Hot Buyer** | ❌ Every buyer is different | ✅ Perfect—adapt to each buyer |
| **Transaction Checklist** | ✅ Good if milestones are sequential | ✅ Also good—some tasks happen in parallel |
| **Advocate VIP Touches** | ❌ No set order | ✅ Perfect—do what fits the moment |

**Perfect Use Cases for Task List Style:**

| Workflow | Why Task List Works |
|----------|------------------|
| **Hot Buyers** | Buyer pace varies, you adapt to their needs |
| **Active Sellers** | Some want staging, some want repairs, order varies |
| **Advocates** | VIP touches happen opportunistically, not sequentially |
| **Transaction Management** | Some tasks happen in parallel (inspection, appraisal, loan) |

**HOW to Create a Task List Workflow (Video - 4-5 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

**Example: Hot Buyer Task List**

1. Go to More → Settings → People and Companies
2. Find "Buyer" Segment (or create a "Hot Buyer" Sub-Segment)
3. Tap the gear icon ⚙️
4. Select "Next Steps"
5. Choose "Task List" style
6. Click "+ Add Step" and create your checklist:

**Task: Review pre-approval letter**
   - Reminder: When first activated
   - Note: "Check expiration date, verify amount"

**Task: Create buyer profile in Properties**
   - Reminder: When activated
   - Note: "Enter price range, beds, baths, location, features"

**Task: Send initial property matches**
   - Reminder: 1 day after profile created
   - Link template: "Property Match Email"

**Task: Schedule property showings**
   - Reminder: When activated
   - Note: "Use showing scheduler or coordinate manually"

**Task: Follow up after showings**
   - Reminder: Day after showing
   - Link template: "Post-Showing Follow-Up"

**Task: Check in on timeline**
   - Reminder: Every 7 days
   - Link template: "Timeline Check-In"

**Task: Send market update**
   - Reminder: Every 14 days
   - Link template: "Market Update Email"

**Task: Refer to preferred lender (if needed)**
   - Reminder: Only if activated
   - Link template: "Lender Referral"

**Task: Prepare offer strategy**
   - Reminder: When buyer is ready
   - Note: "Comps, offer price, terms, contingencies"

7. Save the Task List template

8. Show how it works:
   - Create new contact: "Emily Johnson"
   - Set Segment to "Buyer" and Stage to "Hot"
   - Task List appears with all tasks visible
   - Manually select first task: "Review pre-approval letter"
   - Mark it complete
   - Manually select next task based on Emily's situation: "Create buyer profile"
   - Continue in whatever order makes sense

**Pro Tip:**

> "Use Task List style when you need a comprehensive checklist but the order depends on the client. Think of it as your process menu—everything you might need to do is listed, but you pick what fits the moment."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if I want some tasks to auto-remind me without marking them active?"
  - A: Set recurring reminders on individual tasks. They'll fire even if the task isn't currently active.

- Q: "What if I complete all tasks but want to keep the client in this Segment?"
  - A: That's fine—completed tasks stay completed. You can add new tasks as needed or reset the checklist.

- Q: "Can I re-order tasks after I create them?"
  - A: Yes—drag and drop to reorder in the Next Steps settings. The order affects how they display, but in Task List style, you can complete them in any order anyway.

- Q: "What if I need some tasks to be required and others optional?"
  - A: Use Mixed style (Process for required sequential tasks, Task List for optional/flexible tasks). Or use categories/labels in task names to indicate priority.

- Q: "What if I want to skip tasks that aren't relevant?"
  - A: Just don't activate them. In Task List style, you manually pick what's next, so irrelevant tasks can stay inactive.

**HOW to Implement These Workflows (Video - 3-4 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

1. Choose a workflow from the examples above
2. Go to More → Settings → People and Companies
3. Select the Segment it applies to (e.g., "Buyer" for Buyer Consultation)
4. Create Next Steps using the template
5. Customize steps to match your process:
   - Add your own templates
   - Adjust timing
   - Add/remove steps
6. Save
7. Test with a real contact:
   - Create or select a contact
   - Set their Segment
   - Watch Next Steps populate
   - Walk through the first 2-3 steps

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "Can I use multiple workflows for the same Segment?"
  - A: No—each Segment has ONE Next Steps template. But you can create Sub-Segments (e.g., "Buyer - First Time" and "Buyer - Investor") with different templates.

- Q: "What if I want to switch a contact from one workflow to another mid-process?"
  - A: Change their Segment. Their current Next Steps will stop, and the new Segment's Next Steps will start. Completed steps from the old workflow remain in their timeline history.

- Q: "Can I export/import Next Step templates?"
  - A: Not directly, but you can document your workflows (like the templates above) and manually recreate them in another Cloze account or share with team members.

- Q: "What if I need a workflow that doesn't fit any of these examples?"
  - A: Build your own! These are starting points. Customize to match your unique process.

## MODULE T5: LINKING TEMPLATES TO NEXT STEPS

### Automate Your Best Emails

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Wastes time rewriting emails | "You've sent the same buyer guide email 50 times. Why are you rewriting it each time? Link a template to that Next Step and it auto-loads when you need it." |
| B | Inconsistent messaging | "Sometimes your intro email is great. Sometimes you're rushing and it's mediocre. Templates ensure every client gets your A-game message, every time." |
| C | Wants faster execution | "Linking templates to Next Steps means one click loads your pre-written, proven email. Edit if needed, send. What took 5 minutes now takes 30 seconds." |

**Story to include:**

> "I created 10 email templates for my buyer process—intro email, buyer guide, lender referrals, property matches, offer prep, post-showing follow-up. Then I linked each template to its corresponding Next Step. Now when Cloze reminds me 'Send buyer guide to Sarah,' I click the step, the template loads, I personalize one sentence, send. I've sent that email 100 times and it still sounds fresh because the template is solid and I tweak it to fit each buyer."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**How Template Linking Works:**

```
NEXT STEP:
"Send buyer guide PDF"
   ↓
LINKED TEMPLATE:
"Buyer Guide Email"
   ↓
ONE CLICK:
Template loads in email composer
   ↓
YOU:
Personalize, send, mark step complete
```

**Templates You Can Link:**

| Template Type | Use Case | Example |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| **Personal Email** | One-to-one messages | Intro email, consultation follow-up |
| **Marketing Email** | Designed newsletters | Market update, listing announcement |
| **Text Message** | SMS templates | Quick check-in, showing confirmation |
| **Call Script** | Phone call talking points | Buyer consultation agenda, listing pitch |

**Creating Templates in the Library:**

Templates live in More → Library. Create them once, link to multiple Next Steps.

**Example Template: Buyer Guide Email**

```
Subject: Your Homebuyer Guide

Hi [First Name],

Thanks for connecting! I'm excited to help you find your next home.

I've put together a comprehensive buyer guide that walks you through the entire process—from getting pre-approved to closing day. It answers the most common questions I get from buyers.

[Attach: Buyer Guide PDF]

Let's schedule a time to chat about your needs and timeline. When works best for you this week?

Looking forward to working together!

[Your Name]
[Your Contact Info]
```

**Linking Process:**

1. Create template in Library

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if I want to use a template but not link it to a Next Step?"
  - A: You can! Templates in the Library are always accessible from the email composer. Just click the template icon and select one.

- Q: "What if I need to update a template?"
  - A: Edit it in the Library. The updated template will be used for all future Next Steps that link to it. Past emails you've already sent don't change.

- Q: "Can I link multiple templates to one Next Step?"
  - A: No—one template per step. But you can create alternative versions and link them to different Segments or Steps.

- Q: "What if the template doesn't fit a specific contact?"
  - A: Edit before sending! Templates are starting points. Always personalize before hitting send.

- Q: "Can I see which Next Steps are linked to a template?"
  - A: Yes—open the template in Library and it shows where it's linked (if that feature is available in your Cloze version). Otherwise, check your Next Steps settings.

## MODULE T6: RECURRING TASKS & REMINDERS

### Automate Your Regular Check-Ins and Routines

**WHY (Video - 3-4 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Forgets regular tasks | "You plan to call your top 20 past clients quarterly. By month 3, you've forgotten. Recurring tasks ensure it happens automatically every 90 days." |
| B | Overwhelmed by manual scheduling | "You're manually creating 'Call Sarah in 30 days' every single month for every client. Recurring tasks do this once, repeat forever." |
| C | Wants consistent touchpoints | "Your Advocates get inconsistent outreach—sometimes monthly, sometimes you forget for 3 months. Recurring tasks create consistent rhythm." |

**Story to include:**

> "I wanted to call my top 10 Advocates every quarter for a 'check-in and referral ask.' I'd create the task, complete it, then forget to schedule the next one. Three months later, I'd realize I hadn't called them in 6 months. I set up a recurring task: 'Call Top Advocates' every 90 days. Now on the 90th day, the task appears in my Agenda automatically. I call them, mark it complete, and it auto-schedules for 90 days later. Perfect consistency, zero manual work."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**What Are Recurring Tasks?**

Recurring tasks are **Next Steps that automatically repeat** on a schedule you define (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly).

**Recurring vs. One-Time Tasks:**

| Feature | One-Time Task | Recurring Task |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Frequency** | Happens once | Repeats automatically |
| **Setup** | Create each time | Create once, repeats forever |
| **Use Case** | Specific deadline or milestone | Regular routines, check-ins |
| **Examples** | "Send offer by Friday" | "Monthly newsletter," "Quarterly call" |

**Common Recurring Tasks for Real Estate:**

| Task | Frequency | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Call Top 10 Advocates** | Every 90 days | Quarterly referral ask |
| **Send monthly market update** | 1st of each month | Newsletter to database |
| **Review Active Buyers** | Every Monday | Weekly pipeline check |
| **8x8 Touch** | Every 7 days (8 times) | Ninja Selling 8x8 program |
| **Annual Past Client Check-In** | Yearly (on home anniversary) | Retention and referrals |
| **Quarterly Business Review** | Every 90 days | Personal goals/metrics |
| **Weekly Prospecting Block** | Every Tuesday 9 AM | Lead generation time |

**How Recurring Tasks Work:**

```
CREATE RECURRING TASK:
"Call Top Advocates" - Repeat every 90 days
   ↓
FIRST OCCURRENCE:
Task appears in Agenda on Day 1
   ↓
YOU COMPLETE IT:
Mark task complete
   ↓
AUTO-RESCHEDULE:
Task automatically appears 90 days later
   ↓
REPEAT FOREVER:
Every 90 days, task appears → you complete → auto-reschedules
```

**HOW to Create Recurring Tasks (Video - 5-6 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

**Part 1: Creating a Simple Recurring Task**

1. Go to Agenda (or a Contact)
2. Tap "+ Add Next Step" or "Add Task"
3. Enter task name: "Send monthly newsletter"
4. Set due date: 1st of next month
5. Enable "Repeat" or "Recurring"
6. Choose frequency:
   - **Daily** (every 1, 2, 3... days)
   - **Weekly** (every Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
   - **Monthly** (1st, 15th, last day, etc.)
   - **Quarterly** (every 90 days)
   - **Yearly** (specific date each year)
7. Optional: Set end date ("Repeat until...")
8. Save

**Part 2: Recurring Task for Contacts**

**Example: Quarterly Check-In**

1. Open contact: "Sarah Martinez"
2. Add Next Step: "Quarterly check-in call"
3. Due: 90 days from now
4. Repeat: Every 90 days
5. Save
6. Every 90 days, this task appears for Sarah automatically

**Part 3: Recurring Task for Segments**

**Example: Monthly Newsletter to All Past Clients**

1. Create recurring task: "Send monthly newsletter"
2. Due: 1st of each month
3. Assign to: Yourself (not a specific contact)
4. Linked to: Past Client Audience (optional)
5. Repeat: Monthly
6. Save
7. Every month on the 1st, reminder appears to send newsletter

**Part 4: Recurring Task with Template Link**

**Example: 8x8 Touch Sequence (Weekly for 8 Weeks)**

1. Create recurring task: "8x8 Touch #1"
2. Due: Today (when Segment is set to 8x8)
3. Link template: "8x8 Touch 1 Email"
4. Repeat: Every 7 days
5. Stop after: 8 occurrences
6. Save

Now:
- Week 1: "8x8 Touch #1" appears → Complete
- Week 2: "8x8 Touch #2" appears → Complete
- ... continues for 8 weeks, then stops

**Part 5: Advanced Recurring Options**

**Custom Intervals:**

- Every 3 days
- Every 2 weeks
- Every 6 months
- 1st and 15th of each month (create two recurring tasks)

**Conditional Recurrence:**

- "Repeat until contact moves to Seller stage"
- "Repeat for 6 months, then stop"
- "Repeat only on weekdays" (Monday-Friday)

**Pause and Resume:**

- Pause a recurring task temporarily (e.g., client goes on vacation)
- Resume when ready

**Part 6: Managing Recurring Tasks**

1. View all recurring tasks: Agenda → Filter: "Recurring"
2. Edit recurrence: Open task → Change frequency
3. Skip one occurrence: Mark complete without doing it, or delete that instance
4. Stop recurrence: Edit task → Disable "Repeat"
5. Delete series: Delete the task + choose "Delete all future occurrences"

**Pro Tip:**

> "Use recurring tasks for anything you do on a schedule. Monday morning prospecting? Recurring. Quarterly Advocate calls? Recurring. Monthly newsletter? Recurring. Your brain doesn't have to remember—Cloze does."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if I want to reschedule just one occurrence without changing the whole series?"
  - A: When the task appears, edit the due date for that instance only. It reschedules that occurrence but doesn't affect future repeats.

- Q: "What if I complete a recurring task early?"
  - A: Mark it complete whenever you do it. The next occurrence will still schedule based on the original frequency (not from when you completed it early).

- Q: "Can I have different recurring tasks for different contacts?"
  - A: Yes—each contact can have their own recurring tasks. Example: Sarah gets quarterly calls, Mike gets monthly calls.

- Q: "What if I want a task to recur on specific days (e.g., 1st and 15th)?"
  - A: Create two separate recurring tasks—one for the 1st, one for the 15th.

- Q: "Can I see a history of past completions for a recurring task?"
  - A: Yes—in the contact's timeline or your activity history, you'll see all completed instances with dates.

- Q: "What if I want to temporarily pause a recurring task?"
  - A: Delete the current instance and the task won't reappear until the next scheduled date. Or edit the task and disable recurrence temporarily.

- Q: "Can I set up recurring tasks that assign to different team members?"
  - A: Yes—create the task, set recurrence, and assign to a team member. They'll see it in their Agenda on the recurring schedule.

- Q: "What's the difference between recurring tasks and Keep in Touch reminders?"
  - A: Keep in Touch is relationship-based (reminds you to contact based on time since last interaction). Recurring tasks are action-based (specific tasks on a schedule). Both are useful!
