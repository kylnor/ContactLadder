# CLOZE ADVANCED - Training Outline

## howtoCloze.com / contactladder.com

---

## COURSE OVERVIEW

**Goal:** Get your time back—do in 15 minutes what used to take an hour.

**Prerequisite:** Completed Essentials OR currently doing 10 contacts/day + Agenda 2x daily.

**Structure:** Modular, follows 4MAT (WHY → WHAT → HOW → WHAT IF). Unlike Essentials, these modules are less sequential—agents can tackle them in any order based on their immediate need.

**The Promise:**

> "You've built the habit. You're doing your 10 contacts a day, you're checking your Agenda. Now let's make that work go further. Advanced Cloze is about leverage—reaching more people, finding the right contacts faster, and letting the system do the busywork so you can focus on conversations."

---

## MODULE A1: AUDIENCES

### See Only What Matters

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Doing well, wants more | "You've got 500 contacts organized. But every time you want to find your hot buyers or your advocates in Henderson, you're searching and filtering from scratch. Audiences save that filter so it's one click forever." |
| B | Frustrated by clutter | "Your People screen shows everyone. Your sister, your mortgage guy, that lead from 2019 who ghosted you. Audiences let you create focused lists—like 'My Hot Buyers' or 'Advocates to Thank'—so you only see who matters for the task at hand." |
| C | Power user, wants efficiency | "You're already filtering by segment and tag. But you're doing it manually every time. Audiences save those filters. Build it once, use it forever. This is how you stop repeating yourself." |

**Story to include:**

> "I used to spend five minutes every Monday morning filtering down to my hot buyers. Every. Single. Monday. Then I saved it as an Audience. Now I click 'Hot Buyers' and I'm there in one second. Five minutes times 52 weeks—that's over four hours a year I got back from one saved Audience. And I have twelve of them."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**What's an Audience?**

An Audience is a saved filter. Instead of clicking Filter → Segment → Hot → Stage → Buyer every time, you save that combination and give it a name. One click, you're there.

**Audiences I Recommend Building:**

| Audience Name | What It Shows | When You'd Use It |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Hot Buyers | Segment = Buyer, Stage = Hot | Daily—who needs a call today? |
| Hot Sellers | Segment = Seller, Stage = Hot | Daily—who needs an update? |
| Advocates | Segment = Advocate | Monthly—time for VIP touches |
| Fans to Nurture | Segment = Fan | Weekly—personal outreach list |
| [Area] Buyers | Tag = #henderson (or your area) | When you get a listing in that area |
| Needs Attention | Last contact > 30 days, Segment = Fan or higher | Weekly—who's slipping through cracks? |
| Contacts to Classify | Unclassified contacts | Daily—your 10 per day list (you may already use this!) |

**Key Insight:**

> "Audiences don't create new contacts. They're windows into your existing database. The same person can appear in multiple Audiences if they match multiple filters."

**HOW (Video - 3-4 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

1. Go to People
2. Click Filter icon
3. Build a filter (example: Segment = Buyer + Stage = Hot)
4. Show results narrowing down
5. Click "Save Audience" (or the save icon)
6. Name the Audience: "Hot Buyers"
7. Show the Audience now appears in the left sidebar
8. Click away, click back on the Audience—instant results
9. Show how to edit an Audience (change filters)
10. Show how to delete an Audience you no longer need

**Bonus: Show the "Contacts to Classify" Audience**

> "This one comes built-in. It's your 10-per-day list from Essentials. If you've been filtering manually, start using this Audience instead."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if I want to see the same person in two Audiences?"
  - A: They will. Audiences are just filters. If someone is a Hot Buyer AND tagged #henderson, they'll show up in both "Hot Buyers" and "Henderson Buyers" Audiences.

- Q: "What if I create too many Audiences?"
  - A: You can delete or rename them anytime. Start with 3-4 that match your actual workflow. Add more only when you find yourself repeatedly filtering for the same thing.

- Q: "Can I share Audiences with my team?"
  - A: Audiences are personal to your account. Team Audiences are covered in the Teams Deep Dive.

- Q: "What's the difference between an Audience and a Tag search?"
  - A: A Tag search finds everyone with that tag. An Audience can combine multiple filters—tags AND segments AND stages AND last contact date. Audiences are more powerful.

## MODULE A2: MAIL MERGE

### Personal Emails at Scale

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Doing manual outreach | "You're sending one email at a time. That's fine for five people. But when you've got a new listing and 30 buyers who'd want to know? Mail Merge sends 30 personal emails in the time it takes to write one." |
| B | Using ActivePipe/marketing emails | "ActivePipe is great for newsletters. But those look like marketing. Mail Merge sends emails that look like YOU typed them—because you did. They come from your inbox, not a marketing platform." |
| C | Skeptical of mass email | "I'm not talking about spam. Mail Merge is for situations where you'd normally send the same message to a group—new listing alerts, event invitations, market updates—but you want each one to feel personal." |

**Story to include:**

> "I got a listing in Lake Las Vegas. I searched #lakelasvegas, found 28 buyers who'd mentioned interest. Instead of emailing them one by one, I wrote one message: 'New listing just hit that I think you'll love. Saturday or Sunday for a showing?' Hit Mail Merge. 28 individual emails went out—each from my inbox, each looking like I wrote it just to them. Got six showing requests in an hour."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**What's Mail Merge?**

Mail Merge sends the same email to multiple contacts, but each one arrives as a personal email from your inbox—not a marketing blast. Recipients see it as a one-on-one message from you.

**Mail Merge vs. ActivePipe/Marketing Emails:**

| Feature | Mail Merge | ActivePipe/Marketing |
|---------|------------|----------------------|
| Looks like | Personal email from you | Newsletter/marketing email |
| Sent from | Your actual inbox | Marketing platform |
| Best for | <500 people, relationship-based | 500+ people, branded content |
| Reply goes to | Your inbox directly | Your inbox (varies) |
| Open tracking | Yes | Yes |
| Personalization | Name, basic fields | More design options |

**When to Use Mail Merge:**

- New listing announcement to interested buyers
- Event invitation to advocates/fans
- Market update to a specific area (tag-based)
- "Haven't talked in a while" re-engagement
- Holiday or birthday greetings (if not automated)

**When NOT to Use Mail Merge:**

- More than ~500 recipients (use ActivePipe)
- Highly designed/branded content (use ActivePipe)
- Automated drip sequences (that's Campaigns—see Deep Dive)

**HOW (Video - 3-4 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

1. Start with a filtered list or Audience (example: #lakelasvegas tag)
2. Select all contacts (checkbox at top)
3. Click the checkmark icon at bottom
4. Select "Mail Merge"
5. Write the email subject and body
6. Show the personalization options (first name, etc.)
7. **Show the AI tweak option** - "You can use the lightbulb to adjust tone or rewrite"
8. Preview what recipients will see
9. Hit Send
10. Show where to find open/click tracking after sending

**Key Point:**

> "Each email is individual. If Sarah replies, it comes to your inbox like any normal email. She has no idea 27 other people got a similar message."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if I want to customize individual emails before sending?"
  - A: You can! Before hitting send, you can review and edit each email individually. Most people don't, but the option exists.

- Q: "What if someone unsubscribes?"
  - A: Mail Merge doesn't have an unsubscribe link by default (it's personal email). If someone asks to stop, remove their tag or adjust their segment so they don't appear in that Audience.

- Q: "What if I send to too many people and get flagged as spam?"
  - A: This is why we say under 500. Your email provider may throttle you if you send more than that at once. For large lists, use ActivePipe.

- Q: "Can I schedule a Mail Merge for later?"
  - A: Yes—there's a scheduling option when you send. Great for "send at 9am Tuesday" timing.

- Q: "Can I see who opened my email?"
  - A: Yes. Cloze tracks opens and clicks. You'll see this in the contact's timeline and in your Agenda alerts.

## MODULE A3: BULK EDITING

### Change 100 Contacts in 10 Seconds

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Still editing one-by-one | "You've got 50 people who need a new tag. Or 30 people moving from Warm to Hot. If you're clicking into each contact, that's an hour of work. Bulk editing does it in one click." |
| B | Cleaning up messy data | "You imported a list and everyone came in as 'Sphere of Influence.' Now you need to fix their segments. Bulk editing lets you select all, change all, done." |
| C | Wants to feel like a power user | "This is the feature that separates people who use Cloze from people who master it. Once you learn bulk editing, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it." |

**Story to include:**

> "I had 200 people tagged #investor from years ago. Half of them were no longer active. Instead of clicking into each one to remove the tag, I filtered to #investor, selected the 100 I wanted to clean up, and removed the tag in one action. What would have been an afternoon became two minutes."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**What Can You Bulk Edit?**

| Field | Example Use Case |
|-------|------------------|
| Segment | Move 50 new contacts from SOI to Network after an event |
| Stage | Move all your warm buyers to hot after market shift |
| Tags | Add #openhouse2024 to everyone who attended |
| Tags (remove) | Clean up old tags from people who no longer match |
| Archive | Archive 100 dead leads at once |

**What You CAN'T Bulk Edit:**

- Contact info (phone, email, address)—too risky for mistakes
- Notes, At a Glance, FORD info—these are personal per contact
- Relationships between contacts

**The Bulk Edit Flow:**

1. Filter or View to find your group
2. Select all (or select specific contacts)
3. Click the checkmark icon
4. Choose your action (change segment, add tag, etc.)
5. Confirm
6. Done

**HOW (Video - 2-3 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

1. Go to People, apply a filter (example: Segment = SOI, Tag = #eventattendee)
2. Click checkbox at top to select all visible contacts
3. Click the big checkmark icon at bottom
4. Walk through the options:
   - Change Segment → Select new segment → Apply
   - Add Tag → Type tag → Apply
   - Remove Tag → Select tag → Apply
   - Archive → Confirm → Done
5. Show the contacts updating in real-time
6. Show how to undo if you made a mistake (edit again, change back)

**Warning to Include:**

> "Bulk editing is powerful—which means mistakes are powerful too. Always double-check your filter before you select all. If you accidentally change 500 contacts to the wrong segment, you'll be bulk-editing them back."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if I select too many people by accident?"
  - A: You can deselect individuals before applying the change. Or undo by bulk-editing them back. There's no permanent damage, just extra work.

- Q: "Can I bulk edit from my phone?"
  - A: Limited functionality on mobile. For major bulk work, use desktop.

- Q: "What if I want to bulk edit AND send an email to the same group?"
  - A: Do the bulk edit first, then do the Mail Merge. Two separate actions, same filtered group.

- Q: "Can I bulk delete contacts?"
  - A: You can bulk archive, which hides them from your views. Full deletion requires contacting Cloze support—this is intentional, to prevent accidents.

## MODULE A4: CLOZE AI / MAIA BASICS

### Let MAIA Handle the Busywork

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Struggles with writing | "You know you need to email Sarah, but you stare at the blank screen for five minutes figuring out what to say. MAIA writes a starting draft. You tweak it and send. Blank screen problem: solved." |
| B | Overwhelmed by information | "You've got a call in 10 minutes with someone you haven't talked to in 6 months. Their timeline has 47 emails, 12 calls, and a bunch of notes. MAIA summarizes all of it in one paragraph so you walk into that call prepared." |
| C | Skeptical of AI | "I'm not asking you to let a robot talk to your clients. MAIA does three things: drafts emails you'll edit, summarizes history you don't have time to read, and captures notes so you don't forget. You're still in control. MAIA just handles the busywork." |

**Story to include:**

> "I had a meeting with a past client—closed their house two years ago. I knew I had notes somewhere, but I couldn't remember the details. Thirty seconds before the call, I asked MAIA to summarize what I know about them. She told me: bought in Summerlin, has two kids, husband works at Switch, they were thinking about a vacation home in St. George. I walked into that call like I remembered everything. I didn't. MAIA did."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**Meet MAIA: Your AI Assistant in Cloze**

MAIA (My AI Assistant) is built into Cloze. Look for the sparkle icon ✨. She helps you in three areas:

| Area | What MAIA Does | Time Saved |
|------|----------------|------------|
| **Writing** | Drafts emails, rewrites text, adjusts tone | 3-5 min per email |
| **Reading** | Summarizes contact history and conversations | 5-10 min per contact review |
| **Remembering** | Adds notes, creates reminders, drafts follow-ups | Eliminates "I forgot to..." |

---

### 1. MAIA for Writing

**The Lightbulb Icon (Ghostwriter)**

In the email composer, look for the lightbulb icon 💡. This is Ghostwriter—your AI writing assistant.

| What You Can Do | How It Works |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Draft a new email | Tap lightbulb → Select topic or "Other Topic" → Enter what you want to say → Set tone → Start Writing |
| Edit existing text | Highlight text → Tap lightbulb → Choose: fix grammar, make professional, make authentic, etc. |
| Rewrite if you don't like it | Tap "Rewrite" to generate a new version |
| Include your bio | Add your personal bio as "additional context" for intro emails |

**Pro tip:** You can also ask MAIA directly to draft emails:

> "Draft an email to Jane McKittrick introducing me as a local agent."
> 
> "Write an email to Mike about how it was nice to meet them and hope they have a great vacation and ask them to reach out when they get back and we can talk about next steps with the sale of their home, include my bio."

MAIA drafts it. You review, tweak, and send.

---

### 2. MAIA for Reading

**Timeline Summaries**

Instead of scrolling through months of emails and notes, MAIA summarizes your recent interactions.

| Feature | Where to Find It | What It Shows |
|---------|------------------|---------------|
| Contact Summary | Gray box above the timeline | Overview of recent activity—what you talked about, key points |
| Key Takeaways | Tap "Show Key Takeaways" | Bulleted list of important items from recent conversations |

**How to enable:** More → Settings → Smart Suggestions → Toggle on "Summaries"

**You can also ask MAIA directly:**

> "Summarize what I know about Jared Kim."

MAIA pulls from their timeline and gives you a quick brief.

---

### 3. MAIA for Remembering

After a call or meeting, tell MAIA what happened. She captures it so you don't have to type notes manually.

| What You Say | What MAIA Does |
|--------------|----------------|
| "Add a note that we discussed their timeline for selling and they want to list in March" | Creates a note on the contact's timeline |
| "Remind me to call Brenda Lee next Friday at 2pm" | Creates a Next Step/reminder |
| "Draft a follow-up email summarizing our conversation" | Writes a draft email based on your recent notes |

**The power move:** Right after a call, tap MAIA and say what happened. Notes captured, reminder set, follow-up drafted—before you forget.

---

### How to Talk to MAIA

| Device | To Speak | To Type |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Phone/Tablet** | Tap the MAIA icon (sparkle ✨) | Tap and HOLD the MAIA icon |
| **Computer** | Tap MAIA, then tap the microphone icon | Tap the MAIA icon |

**The sparkle icon ✨ is your entry point. Tap it to start.**

---

**The Human + AI Formula:**

> "MAIA handles the first 80%—the blank page, the information overload, the 'what did we talk about?' problem. You add the 20% that makes it human: the personal reference, the right tone, the thing only you would know to say."

---

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if the AI summary misses something important?"
  - A: Summaries are overviews, not transcripts. The full detail is still in the timeline. Summaries help you get oriented quickly.

- Q: "What if the AI email sounds weird or wrong?"
  - A: Tap "Rewrite" to generate a new version, or edit it yourself. You're always the final filter before send.

- Q: "What if I don't see the summary box above the timeline?"
  - A: You may need to enable it. Go to More → Settings → Smart Suggestions → Toggle on "Summaries."

- Q: "Is MAIA available on all Cloze plans?"
  - A: MAIA is available on Cloze Platinum and above. Check your plan if you don't see the sparkle icon.

- Q: "What if MAIA gets something wrong?"
  - A: AI isn't perfect—always double-check important details. MAIA gives you a starting point, not the final word.

- Q: "Can I use MAIA on both phone and computer?"
  - A: Yes. On phone, tap to speak or tap-and-hold to type. On computer, tap to type or click the microphone to speak.

- Q: "What about deeper AI features like custom prompts or templates?"
  - A: That's covered in the Cloze AI Mastery Deep Dive.
