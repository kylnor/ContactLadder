## MODULE 3.7: CALL SCRIPTS & TEXT TEMPLATES

### Standardize Your Communication for Consistency & Speed

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

**Hook:** "You make the same calls 50 times a year. 8x8 check-ins. Buyer consultations. Listing presentations. Scripts ensure you hit every point, every time. Templates let you text the right message in seconds."

**Story:**

> "I used to wing my 8x8 calls. Sometimes I'd forget to ask about referrals. Sometimes I'd ramble. I created a simple script - 5 key questions, 2-minute call. My 8x8 completion rate went from 60% to 95% because the calls were consistent, comfortable, and quick."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

### Call Scripts vs Text Templates

| Feature | Call Scripts | Text Templates |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | Structure phone conversations | Speed up text messaging |
| **Format** | Question/response flow | Pre-written messages |
| **Flexibility** | Use as guide, adapt live | Use as-is or customize |
| **Best For** | Complex conversations (consultations) | Quick responses, confirmations |

### When to Use Scripts

✅ **8x8 Check-Ins** - Consistent relationship building
✅ **Buyer Consultations** - Cover all critical points
✅ **Seller CMAs** - Present value confidently
✅ **Past Client Annual Reviews** - Structured check-in
✅ **FSBO/Expired Calls** - Navigate objections

### When to Use Text Templates

✅ **Showing confirmations** - "See you at 123 Maple at 3pm"
✅ **Quick responses** - "Got it, will follow up tomorrow"
✅ **Appointment scheduling** - "What time works best for you?"
✅ **Property alerts** - "New listing just hit - matches your criteria"

## SECTION 1: CREATING CALL SCRIPTS

**HOW to Build Effective Scripts (Video - 4-5 min)**

### Script Structure (3-Part Framework)

**1. OPENING (10-15 seconds)**
- Identify yourself
- State purpose
- Get permission to continue

**2. BODY (1-3 minutes)**
- Ask questions
- Provide value
- Address concerns

**3. CLOSING (15-30 seconds)**
- Summarize next steps
- Set expectations
- Thank them

### Example: 8x8 Check-In Script

```
OPENING:
"Hi [Name], it's [Your Name] with [Brokerage]. How are you?

I'm doing my monthly check-ins with my favorite people. Got 2 minutes?"

[Wait for yes]

BODY:
1. "How's everything going with you and [Spouse/Family]?"
   [Listen, respond authentically]

2. "How's the house treating you? Anything need fixing or updating?"
   [Listen for pain points]

3. "Real estate market has been [interesting/crazy/busy] lately.
    Do you know anyone thinking about buying or selling?"
   [Referral ask]

4. "I'm always here if you need contractor recommendations,
    market updates, or just want to grab coffee. Sound good?"
   [Reinforce availability]

CLOSING:
"Perfect! I'll check in again in a month or two. You have my number
 if anything comes up. Thanks for the time, [Name]!"

[End call warmly]
```

**Time:** 2-3 minutes total

### Example: Buyer Consultation Script

```
OPENING:
"Hi [Name], thanks for meeting with me. I want to understand exactly
 what you're looking for so I can help you find the perfect home.
 I've got about 10 questions - should take 15 minutes. Sound good?"

BODY - QUALIFYING QUESTIONS:
1. Budget: "What's your comfortable price range?"
2. Pre-approval: "Have you talked to a lender yet?"
3. Timeline: "When are you hoping to move in?"
4. Must-haves: "What are your non-negotiables?"
5. Nice-to-haves: "What would be nice but you could live without?"
6. Location: "Which areas are you considering?"
7. Home type: "Single-family, condo, townhome preference?"
8. Decision-makers: "Who's involved in the decision?"
9. Motivation: "What's driving the move?"
10. Concerns: "What worries you most about buying?"

BODY - VALUE PROPOSITION:
"Here's how I work with buyers:
- I'll send you listings that match your criteria
- We'll tour properties on your schedule
- I'll handle all negotiations and paperwork
- You don't pay me - the seller does
- My goal: Find you the right home, not just any home"

CLOSING:
"Let's get you set up on property alerts. I'll send you listings
 this week. What days work best for showings?"

[Schedule next steps]
```

**Time:** 15-20 minutes

## SECTION 3: BEST PRACTICES

### Do's and Don'ts

**CALL SCRIPTS:**

✅ **DO:**
- Use as guide, not word-for-word
- Practice until natural
- Adapt to conversation flow
- Listen more than talk
- End with clear next steps

❌ **DON'T:**
- Sound robotic
- Rush through questions
- Ignore their responses
- Pitch before building rapport
- Skip the closing/next steps

**TEXT TEMPLATES:**

✅ **DO:**
- Personalize with names
- Keep under 160 characters (when possible)
- Use correct grammar/spelling
- Include clear call-to-action
- Respond quickly (templates speed this up)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Send walls of text (break into multiple)
- Overuse emojis (1-2 max)
- Use templates for sensitive topics
- Copy-paste obvious templates
- Text after 9pm (unless urgent/expected)

### When to Customize vs Use Template

**Use Template AS-IS:**
- Appointment confirmations
- "Got it" acknowledgments
- Standard scheduling questions

**Customize Template:**
- Emotional situations (offer rejected, deal fell through)
- Complex questions
- Personal conversations
- First contact with new lead
