## MODULE P1: PROPERTIES OVERVIEW

### Why Track Properties in Cloze?

**WHY (Video - 3-4 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Uses separate MLS/transaction tools | "You're searching properties in your MLS, tracking buyers in Cloze, and managing deals in a spreadsheet. Three systems for one job. Properties consolidates it all into Cloze." |
| B | Manually matching buyers to listings | "You've got a new listing. Now you're scrolling through your buyer list thinking 'who wanted 4 bedrooms in Summerlin?' Let Cloze's matching engine find them for you in 5 seconds." |
| C | Wants better transaction tracking | "From the day you list a property to the day it closes, Properties tracks every step—offers, contingencies, inspections, close date—all linked to the buyer, seller, and other agents. One timeline, complete story." |

**Story to include:**

> "I used to keep a spreadsheet of my buyer preferences—price range, bedrooms, neighborhoods, all hand-typed. When I got a new listing, I'd scan the spreadsheet, email 5-10 people individually, and hope I remembered everyone. With Properties, I add the listing once, Cloze shows me every matching buyer instantly, and I send a curated property alert to all of them in one click. What took 30 minutes now takes 2."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**Properties Has Three Main Functions:**

| Function | What It Does | Who Uses It |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Search MLS** | Search your entire local MLS from within Cloze | All agents with MLS access |
| **Match Buyers to Properties** | Build buyer profiles, auto-match to listings | Buyer agents |
| **Track Transactions** | Create deals, link contacts, manage timeline | Listing and buyer agents |

**The Complete Workflow:**

```
BUYER SIDE:
1. Create buyer profile with preferences
   ↓
2. Cloze auto-matches to MLS listings
   ↓
3. Curate and send property alerts
   ↓
4. Track buyer engagement (opens, clicks)
   ↓
5. Create transaction when offer accepted
   ↓
6. Track through close

LISTING SIDE:
1. Add your listing to Cloze
   ↓
2. Cloze finds matching buyers in your database
   ↓
3. Send listing alerts to interested buyers
   ↓
4. Create transaction when offer accepted
   ↓
5. Track through close
```

**Key Insight:**

> "The matching engine works both ways. Buyers match TO listings (what's new on the market for them?). Listings match TO buyers (who in my database wants this?). Both save you hours of manual work."

**Requirements:**

- Cloze Business Platinum Plan
- MLS integration through your brokerage (contact support@cloze.com for setup)
- Supports all major MLS standards

**HOW to Access Properties (Video - 1 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

1. Open Cloze (web or mobile)
2. Tap "Properties" in main navigation (next to People, Projects, etc.)
3. Show the Properties dashboard:
   - Active listings
   - Buyer profiles
   - Transactions in progress
4. Point out the Search icon (MLS search)
5. Point out the + icon (add property or buyer profile)

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if my brokerage doesn't have an MLS integration yet?"
  - A: Contact support@cloze.com with your brokerage name and MLS provider. Cloze supports all major MLS standards and can usually set up integration quickly.

- Q: "What if I don't have a Platinum plan?"
  - A: Properties requires Cloze Business Platinum or above. Check More → Settings → Subscription to see your current plan or upgrade.

- Q: "Can I use Properties for commercial real estate or land sales?"
  - A: Yes—Properties works for any transaction type. The matching engine is customizable for commercial criteria, land parcels, etc.

## MODULE P2: BUYER PROFILES & MATCHING

### Find the Perfect Property for Every Buyer

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Manually sending listings to buyers | "You're hand-picking properties and emailing them one by one. Buyer profiles + auto-matching means Cloze finds the properties and shows you who to send them to. You just curate and click." |
| B | Forgetting buyer preferences | "Six months ago, Sarah said she wanted a home with a pool in Henderson. You forgot. Now there's a perfect listing and you didn't send it to her. Buyer profiles remember so you don't have to." |
| C | Overwhelmed by MLS results | "Your MLS search returns 200 properties. Only 5 are right for this buyer. Let Cloze filter by their exact criteria—price, beds, baths, location, pool, garage—instantly." |

**Story to include:**

> "I had a buyer who said 'I want 3+ bedrooms, under $500k, in Summerlin or Henderson, with a 2-car garage and a yard for the dog.' I built that profile in Cloze in 90 seconds. From then on, every new listing that matched popped up automatically. I'd review them, pick the 2-3 best, and send a curated email. The buyer felt like I was paying attention. I was—Cloze was doing the searching for me."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**What Is a Buyer Profile?**

A Buyer Profile is a saved set of criteria that defines what a buyer is looking for. Cloze uses this to automatically match MLS listings.

**Matching Criteria You Can Set:**

| Category | Fields | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Price** | Min/Max price range | $400k - $550k |
| **Property Details** | Beds, baths, sqft, lot size | 3+ beds, 2+ baths, 1800+ sqft |
| **Location** | Cities, neighborhoods, zip codes | Summerlin, Henderson, 89135 |
| **Features** | Pool, garage, stories, HOA | Pool, 2-car garage, single-story |
| **Property Type** | Single family, condo, townhome | Single family homes only |
| **Custom Fields** | Any MLS field you want to track | Schools, view, gated, etc. |

**How Matching Works:**

Once you create a buyer profile:
1. Cloze searches your MLS automatically
2. New matching listings appear in the buyer's profile
3. You get notified when new matches arrive
4. You curate and send the best options to the buyer
5. Track opens and clicks to see engagement

**The Curated Property Alert:**

Instead of forwarding raw MLS links, Cloze lets you:
- Select multiple matching properties
- Add a personal note to each
- Send a beautifully formatted email with photos
- Track opens and link clicks
- See which properties they're most interested in

**HOW (Video - 4-5 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

**Part 1: Creating a Buyer Profile**

1. Open the buyer's contact record in Cloze
2. Tap "Properties" or "Add Property Criteria"
3. Enter their preferences:
   - Price range: $400k - $550k
   - Bedrooms: 3 minimum
   - Bathrooms: 2 minimum
   - Location: Summerlin, Henderson
   - Features: Pool, 2-car garage
4. Save the profile
5. Show Cloze immediately searching MLS and displaying matches

**Part 2: Reviewing Matches and Sending Alerts**

1. Open the buyer profile in Properties
2. See the list of matching properties
3. Review each property (click to see full MLS details)
4. Select 2-3 properties to send
5. Tap "Send Property Alert" or "Mail Merge"
6. Add personal note: "Hi Sarah, these just hit the market and match what you're looking for. Want to see them this weekend?"
7. Preview the email (shows property photos, details, your note)
8. Send
9. Show tracking: "Sarah opened the email 3 times and clicked the Henderson listing twice"

**Part 3: Updating the Profile**

1. Buyer changes criteria (now wants 4 bedrooms, increased budget)
2. Edit the profile
3. Show new matches appearing based on updated criteria

**Pro Tip:**

> "When a buyer says 'I'm flexible on bedrooms but MUST have a pool,' make the pool a required field and leave bedrooms as a wider range. The matching engine respects which criteria are must-haves vs nice-to-haves."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if a buyer wants properties in multiple completely different areas?"
  - A: You can create multiple profiles for the same buyer if their criteria are drastically different (e.g., one profile for Summerlin homes, another for Henderson condos).

- Q: "What if a property matches their criteria but I know they won't like it?"
  - A: Don't send it. The matching engine gives you candidates—you're the curator. Your job is to pick the 2-3 best, not forward every match.

- Q: "What if the buyer's criteria are so specific that nothing matches?"
  - A: Widen the criteria slightly or set up alerts for when new listings appear. Sometimes the perfect property just hasn't hit the market yet.

- Q: "Can I save a search without linking it to a specific buyer?"
  - A: Buyer profiles are linked to contacts. If you want to monitor a market segment (e.g., all luxury homes in a neighborhood), create a general "Market Watch" contact and build a profile for tracking.

- Q: "What if the MLS data is wrong or outdated?"
  - A: MLS data syncs from your broker's MLS feed. If something's wrong, it's an MLS listing issue, not a Cloze issue. Contact the listing agent or your MLS admin.

## MODULE P3: LISTING PROPERTIES & SELLER MATCHING

### Get Your Listings in Front of the Right Buyers

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Manually emailing listings to database | "You just got a new listing. You email your entire buyer list hoping someone's interested. With seller matching, Cloze shows you exactly who's looking for this property before you hit send." |
| B | Missing potential buyers | "That listing you got last week? There were 8 people in your database actively looking for that exact property. You sent it to 3 of them. Cloze would have shown you all 8." |
| C | Wants faster marketing turnaround | "From listing agreement to property alerts to social media flyer, Properties + MAIA does it all in 5 minutes. Add the listing once, Cloze handles the rest." |

**Story to include:**

> "I listed a 3-bed, 2-bath home in Henderson with a pool for $485k. I added it to Properties, and Cloze immediately showed me 12 buyers in my database whose profiles matched. I didn't have to remember who wanted Henderson or who needed a pool—Cloze did that for me. I sent a curated alert to all 12. Four requested showings that day. One wrote an offer 48 hours later."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**What Happens When You Add a Listing:**

| Step | What Cloze Does | What You Do |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| **1. Add Listing** | Create property record with MLS details | Enter address, price, beds, baths, features |
| **2. Seller Matching** | Cloze finds buyers whose profiles match this property | Review the list of matched buyers |
| **3. Property Alert** | Send curated email to matched buyers | Add personal note, select buyers, send |
| **4. Marketing Materials** | MAIA generates Canva flyers, social posts | Review, customize, download |
| **5. Transaction Creation** | When offer accepted, create deal | Link buyer, track to close |

**Property Details You Can Track:**

- Address, price, sqft, lot size
- Beds, baths, garage, stories
- Features (pool, view, upgrades, HOA)
- Photos (link to MLS or upload your own)
- Listing date, close date, status
- Commission, co-op split
- Marketing notes, open house schedule

**Seller Matching = Reverse Buyer Matching:**

- You add a listing
- Cloze searches ALL buyer profiles in your database
- Shows you everyone whose criteria match this property
- You send targeted alerts to those buyers
- Track engagement to see who's most interested

   - Mike Torres - 3+ beds, $450k-$500k, Henderson ✅
   - Jessica Kim - 4 beds, $400k-$550k, anywhere (partial match)

4. Preview the email (property photos, details, your note)
5. Send
6. Track opens and clicks in each buyer's timeline

**Part 4: Creating Marketing Materials with MAIA**

2. Say: "Create a Canva flyer for this listing"
3. MAIA generates a Canva design with:
   - Property photos
   - Address, price, beds, baths
   - Key features
   - Your contact info
4. Open in Canva, customize colors/fonts
5. Download and share

**Alternative: Ask MAIA Directly**

> "Create a listing flyer for 123 Main Street, Henderson"

MAIA finds the property in your Properties tab and generates the flyer.

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if I get a listing that's not in the MLS yet?"
  - A: You can manually create the property in Cloze before it hits MLS. Add all details yourself, then update with MLS data later.

- Q: "What if no buyers match my listing?"
  - A: Either your database doesn't have buyers looking for this property type, or their profiles need updating. Consider widening your search or manually selecting buyers who might be interested even if they don't match exactly.

- Q: "What if I want to send the listing to my entire database, not just matched buyers?"
  - A: You can. Go to People, select your buyer segment or a custom Audience, and send a Mail Merge. Seller matching just helps you prioritize who's most likely to be interested.

- Q: "Can I track open houses in Properties?"
  - A: Yes—add open house dates and times to the property notes or create a Next Step for "Open House on Saturday 1-3pm." You can also use Calendar integration to sync open house events.

- Q: "What if I co-list with another agent?"
  - A: Add the co-listing agent to the property's Deal Team (covered in Module P4). They'll see the property details and can collaborate on buyer outreach.

## MODULE P4: TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT

### Track Deals from Offer to Close

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Uses separate transaction software | "You're tracking deals in Dotloop or a spreadsheet, but your client conversations are in Cloze. Properties brings the deal AND the relationship into one place." |
| B | Forgets transaction deadlines | "Inspection due in 3 days. Appraisal contingency expires Friday. You're juggling 5 deals and relying on memory. Next Steps in Properties reminds you before deadlines slip." |
| C | Wants complete client timeline | "When a past client refers someone, you want to see their full history—when they bought, what property, how the transaction went. Properties makes that one click." |

**Story to include:**

> "I used to track deals in a spreadsheet with columns for contingencies, deadlines, and close dates. It worked until I had 4 deals going at once. I missed an appraisal deadline because I forgot to check the spreadsheet. Now I create transactions in Properties, set Next Steps for each deadline, and Cloze reminds me 2 days before. I haven't missed a deadline since."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

  - A: Cloze can integrate with multiple MLS systems if your brokerage has access. Contact support to set up multi-MLS access.

- Q: "Can I search other agents' listings?"
  - A: Yes—you're searching the full MLS, not just your own listings. You'll see all active listings that match your search criteria.

- Q: "What if MLS data is delayed or inaccurate?"
  - A: MLS data syncs from your broker's MLS feed. Sync frequency depends on your MLS provider (typically every 15-60 minutes). If data is wrong, it's an MLS issue, not Cloze.

- Q: "Can I import my existing listings from MLS into Cloze?"
  - A: Yes. Search for your listings in the MLS integration, then add them to your Properties. Historical listings may need manual entry depending on MLS data availability.

## MODULE P6: PROPERTIES + MAIA

### Use AI to Supercharge Your Property Marketing

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Creates marketing materials manually | "You're spending 20 minutes per listing creating flyers in Canva, copying details from the MLS. MAIA creates a professional flyer in 30 seconds by pulling data from your Properties tab." |
| B | Wants faster turnaround time | "From listing agreement to flyer to social media post to property alert—MAIA + Properties does it all in under 5 minutes. Your listing hits the market before your competition finishes their photos." |
| C | Struggles with property descriptions | "Writing compelling listing descriptions is hard. MAIA writes them for you based on the property details in Cloze, then you tweak to match your style." |

**Story to include:**

> "I used to dread creating listing flyers. I'd open Canva, find a template, type in the address, price, beds, baths, copy features from my notes, resize photos, adjust colors. 30 minutes later I'd have a flyer. Now I tell MAIA 'Create a listing flyer for 456 Oak Street' and she generates a complete design in Canva with all the details pulled from Properties. I customize colors, download, and I'm done in 3 minutes."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**MAIA + Properties Integration:**

| What You Can Ask MAIA | What MAIA Does | Output |
|----------------------|---------------|--------|
| "Create a Canva flyer for [address]" | Pulls property data, generates Canva design | Editable flyer in Canva |
| "Write a listing description for [address]" | Generates compelling property description | Text you can copy/paste |
| "Generate a social media post for [address]" | Creates post copy with property highlights | Ready-to-post text |
| "Push this property to Cloud CMA" | Sends property data to Cloud CMA | Auto-filled CMA report |
| "Send this listing to HomeSpotter" | Pushes to HomeSpotter for ad campaigns | Auto-updated ad campaign |
| "Summarize activity on [address]" | Reviews timeline for this property | Summary of buyer interest, showings, etc. |

**Requirements:**

- Property data entered in Properties tab
- Connected integrations (Canva, Cloud CMA, HomeSpotter as needed)

**How It Works:**

1. You add property details to Cloze Properties (address, price, beds, baths, features, photos)

4. Copy the text, tweak as needed, use for MLS description or marketing

**Part 3: Generating Social Media Posts**

1. Tap MAIA, say: "Create a social media post announcing my new listing at 123 Sunset Drive"
2. MAIA generates:
   > "🏡 NEW LISTING ALERT! 🏡
   > Just listed: 123 Sunset Drive, Summerlin
   > 4 beds | 3 baths | 2,800 sqft | Pool | Mountain Views
   > $525,000
   > This one won't last! DM me for a private showing. 🔑"
3. Copy, paste to Instagram/Facebook, add photos

**Part 4: Pushing to Integrations**

1. Say: "Push 123 Sunset Drive to Cloud CMA"
2. MAIA sends property data to Cloud CMA
3. You finish the CMA report in Cloud CMA with pre-filled property details

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if MAIA generates a flyer with wrong information?"
  - A: MAIA pulls from your Properties record. If the info is wrong, fix it in Properties, then regenerate the flyer.

- Q: "What if I don't like the Canva template MAIA chooses?"
  - A: You can manually select a different template in Canva after MAIA generates the initial design. All the property data is already filled in—just change the layout.

- Q: "What if I want to customize the listing description MAIA writes?"
  - A: Always customize! MAIA writes a solid first draft. Add your personal touches, specific callouts, or style preferences before using it.

- Q: "Can MAIA create flyers for properties I don't have in Cloze yet?"
  - A: No—MAIA needs the property data in Properties to generate materials. Add the property first, then ask MAIA to create the flyer.

- Q: "What if I want MAIA to use my specific branding (colors, fonts, logo)?"
  - A: Set up your branding in Canva as your default theme. MAIA will use Canva's templates, but you can quickly apply your brand settings in Canva after generation.

## MODULE P7: THE MATCHING ENGINE

### Understanding and Optimizing Cloze's Matching Algorithm

**WHY (Video - 3-4 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Gets too many irrelevant matches | "You set up a buyer profile and get 50 property matches. Only 3 are actually relevant. The matching engine isn't broken—you just need to understand how to tune it." |
| B | Missing perfect matches | "The perfect property for your buyer hit the MLS yesterday. It matched their criteria exactly. You never saw it because one field was configured wrong. Mastering the matching engine prevents this." |
| C | Wants to automate more | "You're still manually searching MLS every morning for each buyer. The matching engine can do this automatically—you just review and send. But only if you set it up right." |

**Story to include:**

> "I had a buyer who wanted a very specific property: 4 bedrooms, $450-$500k, Henderson, must have a pool and RV parking. I set up their profile and got 3 matches a week. Then I realized I'd set RV parking as 'preferred' not 'required.' I was missing properties WITH RV parking because the MLS field wasn't always filled out. I changed my strategy: made the pool required, widened the price range slightly, and set up a secondary profile without the RV requirement. Now I get 8-10 matches weekly and manually filter for RV parking. Perfect match rate went from 20% to 80%."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**How the Matching Engine Works:**

The matching engine compares buyer profiles to MLS listings using a weighted scoring system:

```
BUYER PROFILE CRITERIA:
- Required fields (must match exactly)
- Preferred fields (scored, but not required)
- Weighted fields (some criteria matter more than others)
   ↓
MATCHING ENGINE ALGORITHM:
- Searches MLS for listings meeting required criteria
- Scores properties based on preferred fields
- Ranks matches by total score
- Presents top-scoring properties first
   ↓
OUTPUT:
- High-quality matches (90-100% score)
- Good matches (70-89% score)
- Partial matches (50-69% score)
```

**Matching Field Types:**

| Field Type | How It Works | Example | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Required** | Property MUST match to appear | "MUST have pool" | Non-negotiable criteria |
| **Preferred** | Property scores higher if it matches | "Prefers mountain views" | Nice-to-haves |
| **Range** | Property must fall within range | "$400k-$550k" | Flexible on exact number |
| **Weighted** | Some fields count more than others | "Location = 2x weight" | Prioritize what matters most |
| **Exclude** | Property must NOT have this | "No HOA" | Deal-breakers |

**Matching Score Breakdown:**

Cloze assigns each match a score:

- **90-100%:** Perfect match (meets all required + most preferred criteria)
- **70-89%:** Good match (meets all required + some preferred criteria)
- **50-69%:** Partial match (meets required, missing most preferred)
- **<50%:** Weak match (meets minimum requirements only)

**Common Matching Challenges:**

1. **Too Many Matches:** Criteria too broad, need tighter filters
2. **Too Few Matches:** Criteria too narrow, need to relax requirements
3. **Wrong Matches:** Required vs Preferred misconfigured
4. **Missing Matches:** MLS data fields incomplete, need alternate search strategy

**HOW to Optimize Matching (Video - 5-6 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

**Part 1: Setting Up Required vs Preferred Fields**

1. Open a buyer profile
2. Review current matching criteria
3. **Identify true requirements:**
   - Price range: $400-$550k (REQUIRED)
   - Bedrooms: 3+ (REQUIRED)
   - Bathrooms: 2+ (REQUIRED)
   - Location: Summerlin or Henderson (REQUIRED)
4. **Identify preferences:**
   - Pool (PREFERRED, not required)
   - 2-car garage (PREFERRED)
   - Single-story (PREFERRED)
   - Mountain views (PREFERRED)
5. Save and test
6. Review match results—should see more properties, with pool properties ranked higher

**Part 2: Using Weighted Criteria**

1. Buyer says: "Location matters most, then price, then bedrooms"
2. Set weighting in profile:
   - Location: High priority (2x weight)
   - Price: High priority (2x weight)
   - Bedrooms: Medium priority (1x weight)
   - Other features: Low priority (0.5x weight)
3. Matching engine now prioritizes location and price matches
4. Properties in perfect neighborhoods but slightly outside budget may still appear (high location score)

**Part 3: Creating Multiple Profiles for One Buyer**

Sometimes buyers have distinct preferences that don't fit one profile:

**Scenario:** Buyer wants EITHER:
- A) 3-bed condo in Summerlin under $400k, OR
- B) 4-bed single-family in Henderson under $500k

**Solution:** Create 2 profiles:

**Profile A:** "Sarah Martinez - Summerlin Condo"
- Price: $300-$400k
- Beds: 3
- Type: Condo
- Location: Summerlin

**Profile B:** "Sarah Martinez - Henderson SFH"
- Price: $400-$500k
- Beds: 4
- Type: Single-family
- Location: Henderson

Now Sarah gets matches for BOTH property types without noise.

**Part 4: Dealing with Incomplete MLS Data**

**Problem:** Buyer wants RV parking. MLS field "RV Parking" is often blank (agents don't fill it out).

**Solution:**
1. Set "RV Parking" as PREFERRED (not required)
2. Widen other criteria slightly to get more matches
3. Manually review property photos and descriptions for RV parking
4. Use MAIA: "Which of these properties have RV parking based on photos and description?"

**Alternative:** Use keyword search in MLS remarks field for "RV" or "boat parking"

**Part 5: Monitoring Match Quality Over Time**

1. Review matches weekly
2. Track hit rate: What % of matches do you send to the buyer?
   - <20% hit rate = criteria too broad
   - >80% hit rate = criteria might be too narrow (missing properties)
   - 50-70% hit rate = optimal
3. Adjust criteria based on buyer feedback:
   - "I keep seeing condos, but I only want single-family" → Fix property type filter
   - "These are all too small" → Increase sqft minimum
4. Iterate until match quality is consistent

**Part 6: Setting Up Auto-Alerts**

1. Enable auto-notifications for new matches
2. Choose frequency:
   - **Daily digest:** All new matches sent once per day
   - **Instant alerts:** Immediate notification when high-quality match appears
   - **Weekly summary:** Batched matches sent Friday morning
3. Buyer receives alerts automatically
4. You track opens and clicks to see engagement

**Part 7: Using Matching for Market Insights**

Beyond individual buyers, use matching to understand your market:

1. **Create a "Market Watch" profile:**
   - Broad criteria (all homes $300-$600k in your farm area)
   - Monitor weekly to see inventory trends
2. **Track days on market:**
   - How long do matched properties sit?
   - Fast-moving = hot market
   - Slow-moving = softening market
3. **Price trend analysis:**
   - Are matched properties getting price reductions?
   - How often?
   - By how much?

**Part 8: Advanced: Boolean Logic in Matching**

For power users, some MLS integrations support boolean logic:

```
EXAMPLE: Buyer wants pool OR mountain views (either one is fine)

Standard match: Pool (preferred), Mountain views (preferred)
Result: Properties with BOTH score highest

Boolean match: (Pool = Yes) OR (Mountain Views = Yes)
Result: Properties with EITHER pool OR views rank equally high
```

Check with Cloze support if your MLS integration supports boolean matching.

**Pro Tip:**

> "Start with tight required criteria (price, beds, location) and loose preferred criteria (features). Review 50 matches. If quality is poor, tighten preferred criteria. If quantity is too low, loosen required criteria. Finding the sweet spot takes 2-3 iterations, but once dialed in, matching is magic."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if the matching engine shows properties that are clearly wrong (wrong city, wrong price)?"
  - A: This is usually an MLS data error, not a Cloze error. The listing agent may have entered the wrong city or price in the MLS. Report to your MLS admin.

- Q: "What if I want to exclude certain subdivisions or streets?"
  - A: Most MLS integrations allow exclusion filters. Add "Exclude subdivision: [name]" in the profile. If not available, manually filter those out when reviewing matches.

- Q: "What if my buyer's criteria change mid-search?"
  - A: Update the profile immediately. Matching results refresh automatically. Old matches that no longer fit will drop off, new matches will appear.

- Q: "Can I see WHY a property matched?"
  - A: Some integrations show match score breakdown (price: 100%, beds: 100%, pool: 0%, etc.). If yours doesn't, you can infer by comparing listing details to buyer criteria.

- Q: "What if a buyer says 'just send me everything in Henderson under $500k'?"
  - A: Create the profile with those broad criteria, but set up a weekly digest instead of daily alerts. You can manually curate the best 3-5 from the weekly batch instead of overwhelming them with 50 properties.

- Q: "What if I want to match based on school district, not just city?"
  - A: If your MLS has school district as a searchable field, add it to the profile. If not, you'll need to manually verify school districts on matches before sending.

- Q: "Can I match expired listings or off-market properties?"
  - A: The matching engine only works with active MLS listings. For off-market, you'd need to manually add those properties to Cloze and tag them for specific buyers.

- Q: "What if my buyer wants a property that doesn't exist in the current market?"
  - A: Keep the profile active. When a matching property hits the MLS, you'll be notified immediately. This is perfect for buyers with very specific criteria waiting for the right home.
