## MODULE AI1: MAIA DEEP DIVE

### Your AI Assistant, Fully Explained

**WHY (Video - 3-4 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Uses MAIA occasionally | "You're using 10% of what MAIA can do. She drafts emails. But she can also transcribe meetings, create property flyers, push listings to Cloud CMA, summarize entire contact histories, and more. Let's unlock the other 90%." |
| B | Frustrated by limitations | "You ask MAIA to do something and she doesn't understand. That's because you're not asking the right way. MAIA is powerful when you know how to communicate with her." |
| C | Skeptical of AI quality | "AI makes mistakes. True. But so do you when you're tired, rushed, or juggling 10 clients. The trick isn't trusting AI blindly—it's using AI as your first draft, then adding your expertise." |

**Story to include:**

> "I used to spend 10 minutes before every client call reading through old emails to remember what we talked about. With MAIA, I ask 'Summarize what I know about Sarah Martinez' 30 seconds before the call. MAIA tells me: bought in Summerlin 2 years ago, husband works at Switch, two kids, interested in upsizing to 4 bedrooms, timeline is spring. I walk into that call prepared. Sarah thinks I have an incredible memory. I just have MAIA."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**MAIA Capabilities Overview:**

| Category | What MAIA Can Do | Examples |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Contact Management** | Find, search, summarize contacts | "Show me all buyers in Henderson" |
| **Communication** | Draft emails, texts, adjust tone | "Write a check-in email to Mike" |
| **Meeting Support** | Transcribe meetings, extract action items | "Transcribe my call with Sarah" |
| **Property Marketing** | Create Canva flyers, listing descriptions | "Create a flyer for 123 Main St" |
| **Integration Pushes** | Send to Cloud CMA, HomeSpotter | "Push this property to Cloud CMA" |
| **Research & Summarization** | Summarize contacts, conversations, timelines | "What have I talked about with John?" |
| **Task Management** | Create reminders, Next Steps, to-dos | "Remind me to call Brenda next Friday" |

**How to Access MAIA:**

| Device | To Speak | To Type |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Phone/Tablet** | Tap MAIA icon ✨ | Tap and HOLD MAIA icon |
| **Computer** | Tap MAIA, then tap microphone 🎤 | Tap MAIA icon ✨ |

**Understanding MAIA's Context:**

MAIA knows:
- The contact record you're viewing (if you're on a contact page)
- The property you're viewing (if you're on a property page)
- Your recent conversation history
- Your custom prompts and bio (if configured)
- Your Cloze data (segments, tags, notes, timeline)

MAIA does NOT know:
- Information outside of Cloze (external websites, your personal memory)
- Future events (she can't predict)
- Conversations that happened outside Cloze (unless logged)

**Data Privacy & Security:**

> "Everything you do in MAIA stays in Cloze. Your data is never used to train AI models. MAIA is private and secure."

**IMPORTANT: AI Limitations**

- MAIA is in beta—expect occasional bugs or errors
- Always double-check important details (addresses, numbers, dates)
- AI can generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information ("hallucinations")
- MAIA is a tool, not a replacement for your judgment

**HOW to Use MAIA Effectively (Video - 4-5 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

**Part 1: Basic MAIA Commands**

1. Open Cloze
2. Tap the MAIA icon ✨
3. Try these commands:

**"Find all Hot Buyers in Summerlin"**
   - MAIA searches and displays matching contacts

**"Summarize what I know about Sarah Martinez"**
   - MAIA reads Sarah's timeline and provides a summary

**"Draft an email to Mike thanking him for the referral"**
   - MAIA generates an email draft

**"Create a reminder to call Brenda next Friday at 2pm"**
   - MAIA creates the Next Step

**"What properties match John's buyer profile?"**
   - MAIA shows matched properties

**Part 2: Context-Aware Commands**

1. Open a contact: Sarah Martinez
2. Tap MAIA
3. Say: "Draft a check-in email"
   - MAIA knows you're on Sarah's page, drafts an email to Sarah

4. Open a property: 123 Main Street
5. Tap MAIA
6. Say: "Create a Canva flyer"
   - MAIA knows you're viewing this property, creates flyer for 123 Main St

**Part 3: Following Up on MAIA's Responses**

1. Ask MAIA: "Summarize Sarah Martinez"
2. MAIA responds with summary
3. Follow up: "Draft an email checking in on her timeline"
   - MAIA uses the context from the previous question

**Pro Tip:**

> "Be specific. Instead of 'email Mike,' say 'Draft an email to Mike checking in on his buyer timeline and offering to send new property matches.' The more context you give MAIA, the better the output."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if MAIA doesn't understand my request?"
  - A: Rephrase. Try simpler language or break complex requests into steps. Example: Instead of "Do everything for my new listing," try "Create a Canva flyer for my new listing at 456 Oak St."

- Q: "What if MAIA gives me wrong information?"
  - A: Always verify! AI is a starting point. Check dates, numbers, names, and details before using MAIA's output.

- Q: "What if I want MAIA to remember something for future requests?"
  - A: Add it to your bio or create a custom prompt with context (covered in Module AI3).

- Q: "Can MAIA access information outside Cloze?"
  - A: No—MAIA only has access to your Cloze data. She can't browse the web or access external databases.

- Q: "What if I'm concerned about privacy?"
  - A: Your data never leaves the Cloze ecosystem for AI training. MAIA uses AI models to process your requests, but your data remains private.

| B | Wastes time editing | "You write, rewrite, delete, rewrite again. Ghostwriter gives you polished copy on the first shot. Edit if you want, but the heavy lifting is done." |
| C | Wants variety | "Sending the same 'Just checking in' email gets stale. Ghostwriter generates multiple versions—pick the one that fits the moment." |

**Story to include:**

> "I had to introduce myself to a referral from a past client. I stared at the blank email for 5 minutes. 'How do I introduce myself without sounding like every other agent?' I clicked the lightbulb, selected 'Introduce myself,' and Ghostwriter wrote: 'Hi Alex, Brenda Johnson mentioned you're thinking about selling your home and suggested we connect. I'd love to learn more about your timeline and see if I can help. Are you free for a quick call this week?' Perfect. I added one personal line referencing Brenda's daughter's wedding, sent it, got a meeting."

Subject: Brenda Johnson suggested we connect

Hi Alex,

Brenda Johnson mentioned you're thinking about selling your home in Summerlin and thought we should connect. I'd love to learn more about your timeline and see how I can help.

A bit about me: I've been selling homes in the Las Vegas area for 8 years, specializing in Summerlin and Henderson. I'm a Ninja Selling graduate and focus on building genuine relationships with my clients rather than pushy sales tactics. My goal is to make your selling experience as smooth and stress-free as possible.

Would you be open to a quick call this week? I'd love to hear more about your plans.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

3. Click lightbulb
4. Select "Make it more professional"
5. Ghostwriter rewrites:

Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up and see if you're still considering purchasing a home. I'd love to discuss your timeline and help you find the right property.

Let me know if you'd like to schedule a conversation this week.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

```
I'm a Las Vegas real estate agent specializing in first-time homebuyers in Summerlin and Henderson. I've been in the business for 8 years and I'm a Ninja Selling graduate. My approach is relationship-focused—I believe in serving my clients, not selling to them. I grew up in Las Vegas and know the valley inside and out. When I'm not showing homes, I'm hiking Red Rock with my golden retriever, Max.

**Pro Tip:**

> "Use Ghostwriter to overcome writer's block, not to replace your voice. Generate a draft, then add your personal touches—a specific reference, a shared memory, something only YOU would know to say. That's what turns AI copy into authentic connection."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if Ghostwriter's tone doesn't match mine?"
  - A: Customize your bio to reflect your style. The more detailed your bio, the better Ghostwriter matches your voice. Or just edit the draft to fit your tone.

- Q: "What if I want Ghostwriter to remember a specific detail about a contact?"
  - A: Add it to the contact's "At a Glance" field or notes. Ghostwriter can reference information in Cloze when drafting.

  - A: Ghostwriter is optimized for English. Other languages may work but quality varies.

- Q: "What if I want to generate multiple email options and pick the best?"

## MODULE AI3: CUSTOM PROMPTS & CONTEXT

### Teach MAIA Your Unique Process

**WHY (Video - 3-4 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Repeats the same prompts | "You ask MAIA the same thing 10 times a day: 'Draft a buyer check-in email.' Save it as a custom prompt and it's one click forever." |
| B | Wants better AI output | "Generic prompts get generic results. Custom prompts with your context get personalized, on-brand content every time." |
| C | Team needs consistency | "Your team writes emails differently. Custom prompts with your brokerage context ensure everyone sounds professional and aligned with your brand." |

**Story to include:**

> "I send the same type of email every Monday: market update to my Hot Buyers with new listings from the weekend. I used to ask MAIA 'Draft a market update email with new Summerlin listings.' Then I created a custom prompt called 'Weekly Buyer Market Update' that includes my context: tone, format, which neighborhoods to mention, call-to-action. Now I just select the prompt, MAIA generates a perfect email, I add the new listings, done. What took 10 minutes now takes 2."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**What Are Custom Prompts?**

Custom Prompts are **pre-saved Ghostwriter instructions** that you (or your team) create and reuse.

**What Are Custom Contexts?**

Custom Contexts are **additional information you give to Ghostwriter** to improve output. Think of it as teaching MAIA about your business, your style, and your preferences.

**How They Work Together:**

```
CUSTOM PROMPT:
"Buyer Check-In Email"
   ↓
CUSTOM CONTEXT:
- My specialization: First-time buyers
- My tone: Friendly, not salesy
- My CTA: Always include Calendly link
- My area: Summerlin and Henderson
   ↓
GHOSTWRITER OUTPUT:
Personalized email matching your style and process
```

**Types of Custom Prompts You Can Create:**

| Prompt Name | What It Does | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Buyer Check-In** | Weekly check-in with active buyers | "Hi [Name], just checking in on your timeline..." |
| **Listing Presentation Intro** | Intro email before listing appointment | "Looking forward to our meeting Thursday..." |
| **Referral Thank You** | Thank advocates for referrals | "Thank you so much for referring..." |
| **Post-Close Follow-Up** | Check in 30 days after closing | "How are you settling into the new home?" |
| **Event Invitation** | Invite to client appreciation event | "You're invited to our annual BBQ..." |

**Custom Context Examples:**

- **Your Bio:** Background, specialization, approach
- **Your Brand Voice:** Professional vs. casual, formal vs. friendly
- **Your CTA Preferences:** Always include Calendly link, phone number, website
- **Your Market Focus:** Summerlin, Henderson, first-time buyers, luxury, etc.

- Q: "Can I delete custom prompts I no longer use?"
  - A: Yes—go to Library, find the prompt, delete it.

## MODULE AI4: TIMELINE SUMMARIES & KEY TAKEAWAYS

### Never Read Through 50 Emails Again

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Wastes time prepping for calls | "You've got a call with a contact in 5 minutes. Their timeline has 38 emails, 7 calls, and 12 notes. You need a summary. Timeline Summaries give you the highlights in 10 seconds." |
| B | Forgets past conversations | "You talked to this person 3 months ago. What did you discuss? Instead of scrolling, MAIA summarizes: 'Last conversation was about selling in spring, concerned about pricing, wants to interview 3 agents.'" |
| C | Manages many clients | "When you're juggling 15 active deals, you can't remember everyone's details. Summaries refresh your memory instantly before every interaction." |

**Story to include:**

> "I had a Zoom call with a buyer I hadn't talked to in 6 weeks. I had 2 minutes before the call started. I opened her Cloze record, saw the Timeline Summary: 'Pre-approved for $450k, wants 3 beds in Summerlin, concerned about HOA fees, husband travels for work so wants low-maintenance home, timeline is flexible but hoping for spring.' I walked into that call like I'd been thinking about her all week. She was impressed. I just used the Summary."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**Timeline Summaries:**

A Timeline Summary is **an AI-generated overview of your recent interactions** with a contact. It appears as a gray box above the timeline.

**What It Includes:**
- Recent communication topics
- Key points from conversations
- Important details mentioned (timeline, preferences, concerns)
- Action items or next steps
- Overall relationship status

**Key Takeaways:**

Key Takeaways are **bulleted highlights** extracted from recent conversations.

Example:
- Interested in buying within 60 days
- Pre-approved for $500k
- Wants 4 bedrooms, 2-car garage, good schools
- Concerned about interest rates
- Follow up after Labor Day

**How to Enable Timeline Summaries:**

1. Go to More → Settings → Smart Suggestions
2. Toggle on "Summaries"
3. Summaries will now appear above contact timelines

**HOW to Use Timeline Summaries (Video - 3-4 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

**Part 1: Viewing Timeline Summary**

1. Open a contact with recent activity: "Sarah Martinez"
2. Look above the timeline—see the gray Summary box
3. Read the summary:

```
SUMMARY:
You last spoke with Sarah on January 10th about her timeline for upsizing to a 4-bedroom home in Summerlin. She mentioned her lease ends in April and she's hoping to buy before then. Sarah is pre-approved for $550k and wants a single-story home with a pool. She's concerned about finding the right school district for her kids. You agreed to send property matches weekly and check in after the new year.
```

4. Tap "Show Key Takeaways"
5. See bulleted highlights:
   - Wants to buy before April (lease ends)
   - Pre-approved for $550k
   - Needs 4 bedrooms, single-story, pool
   - School district is priority
   - Send weekly property matches

**Part 2: Asking MAIA to Summarize**

1. Tap MAIA icon
2. Say or type: "Summarize what I know about Sarah Martinez"
3. MAIA generates summary (similar to Timeline Summary but on demand)
4. Use this before calls, meetings, or emails

**Part 3: Using Summaries to Draft Emails**

1. Read the Timeline Summary for Mike Torres
2. Tap MAIA
3. Say: "Draft a check-in email to Mike referencing our last conversation"
4. MAIA uses the summary context to write a relevant email:

```
Hi Mike,

I wanted to follow up on our conversation about your investment property search. Have you had a chance to think more about the Henderson area we discussed?

I know you mentioned you're looking for cash-flow properties under $300k. I've got a few new listings that just came on the market that might fit your criteria.

Let me know if you'd like me to send them over!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Pro Tip:**

> "Use Timeline Summaries before EVERY client interaction—calls, meetings, emails. Spend 10 seconds reading the summary, then engage. You'll sound prepared, attentive, and professional every time."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if the summary misses something important?"
  - A: Summaries are highlights, not full transcripts. Always check the timeline for specific details if needed.

- Q: "What if I don't see a summary box?"
  - A: Enable it in Settings → Smart Suggestions → Summaries. If still not showing, the contact may not have enough recent activity to generate a summary.

- Q: "Can I edit or customize the summary?"
  - A: No—summaries are AI-generated and read-only. But you can add notes to the contact's "At a Glance" for key info you want at your fingertips.

- Q: "What if the summary is outdated?"
  - A: Summaries refresh based on recent activity. If you've had new conversations, the summary should update. You can also ask MAIA to re-summarize.

- Q: "Do summaries work for Properties too?"
  - A: Summaries are primarily for People/Contacts. For Properties, you can ask MAIA to summarize activity on a property.

| C | Needs documentation | "He said, she said—who remembers exactly what was discussed? Transcription gives you a word-for-word record of the meeting for CYA and follow-up." |

**Story to include:**

> "I had an in-person listing consultation. We covered pricing strategy, marketing plan, timeline, repairs, staging—an hour of detailed conversation. I used to scribble notes and hope I remembered the key points. Now I use MAIA to transcribe the meeting. After we finish, I review the transcript, pull out action items, and send a follow-up email summarizing everything we discussed. The seller said, 'I'm impressed you remembered every detail.'

- Q: "What if I'm on a Zoom call—can MAIA transcribe that?"
  - A: MAIA can transcribe audio it can hear. If using Zoom, make sure your device's microphone is on and MAIA can access it. Zoom's built-in transcription might be better for virtual meetings.

- Q: "Can I edit the transcript after it's generated?"
  - A: Transcripts are typically read-only, but you can add notes or corrections in the contact's timeline.

- Q: "What if I forget to stop the transcription?"
  - A: Stop it manually when you remember, or it may auto-stop after a certain duration.

- Q: "Is meeting transcription available on all plans?"
  - A: Transcription requires MAIA (Cloze Platinum or above). Check your plan if you don't see this feature.

## MODULE AI6: SMART SUGGESTIONS

### Let AI Tell You Who Needs Attention

**WHY (Video - 3-4 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Contacts go stale | "You've got 300 contacts in Cloze. Who needs a call this week? Who's been ignored too long? Smart Suggestions surfaces the people slipping through the cracks." |
| B | Forgets to follow up | "Sarah said 'follow up in 3 months.' It's been 4. You forgot. Smart Suggestions would've reminded you. AI watches your contacts so you don't have to." |
| C | Incomplete data | "Your buyer's budget is blank. Their timeline is missing. Smart Suggestions flags incomplete profiles so you can fill the gaps before it matters." |

**Story to include:**

> "I had a past client, Mike, who bought from me 2 years ago. I meant to stay in touch, but life got busy. I forgot about him. One day, Cloze sent me a Smart Suggestion: 'Mike Johnson - No activity in 365 days.' I called him that afternoon. Turns out, he was thinking about selling and upgrading. He'd been talking to another agent but hadn't committed yet. I re-engaged just in time. That suggestion saved a $15K commission I almost lost by neglecting the relationship."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**What Are Smart Suggestions?**

Smart Suggestions are **AI-powered alerts** that tell you:
- Which contacts need follow-up
- Who you've neglected too long
- Contacts with missing critical data
- Follow-up opportunities based on conversation context

**Types of Smart Suggestions:**

| Suggestion Type | What It Does | Example |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Stale Contact Alert** | Flags contacts with no activity in X days | "No contact with Sarah Martinez in 90 days" |
| **Missing Data Alert** | Highlights incomplete contact info | "Mike Torres - Missing phone number" |
| **Follow-Up Opportunity** | Suggests timely follow-ups based on timeline | "Alex mentioned buying in March - follow up now" |
| **Keep in Touch Reminder** | Reminds you to reach out per KIT frequency | "Time to check in with Fan segment (60-day KIT)" |
| **Lifecycle Event Alert** | Flags anniversaries, birthdays, home anniversaries | "Sarah's home anniversary is next week" |

**Where Smart Suggestions Appear:**

- **Dashboard** - Top of your main screen
- **Inbox** - Above your email/text feed
- **Contact Records** - On individual contact pages
- **Project View** - On specific audiences or segments

**How Smart Suggestions Work:**

```
CLOZE AI MONITORS:
- Last contact date for each person

I've got some great new listings in Summerlin that match your criteria. Want me to send them over?

Let's schedule a call this week to discuss next steps.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Part 6: Dismissing Suggestions**

Not all suggestions are relevant:

1. See suggestion: "John Smith - No contact in 90 days"
2. You remember: John moved out of state, no longer a lead
3. Tap "Dismiss"
4. Suggestion removed
5. Optional: Update John's segment to "Lost" so future suggestions don't trigger

**Pro Tip:**

> "Check Smart Suggestions every Monday morning. Make it your weekly routine: see who needs attention, batch your outreach, keep relationships warm. 10 minutes on Monday saves you from losing touch with high-value contacts."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if I get too many suggestions and feel overwhelmed?"
  - A: Adjust sensitivity settings. Increase stale contact threshold to 90 or 120 days. Turn off missing data alerts if you don't need them. Focus on follow-up opportunities and KIT reminders only.

- Q: "What if a suggestion is irrelevant (contact moved, no longer a lead)?"
  - A: Dismiss it. If the contact is truly inactive, update their segment to "Lost" or archive them to prevent future suggestions.

- Q: "What if I don't want suggestions for certain contacts?"
  - A: You can't exclude individuals, but you can adjust segment KIT frequencies. Set "Lost" or "Dead" segments to "Never" KIT so they don't trigger alerts.

- Q: "Can I customize which types of suggestions I see?"
  - A: Yes—go to Settings → Smart Suggestions and toggle each category on/off.

- Q: "What if I want suggestions for a specific segment only (e.g., just Buyers)?"
  - A: Create an Audience filter: "Buyers with no activity in 60 days." Check this audience weekly instead of relying on general suggestions.

- Q: "How often do Smart Suggestions refresh?"
  - A: Daily. New suggestions appear based on updated contact activity and thresholds.

- Q: "What if I act on a suggestion but it doesn't dismiss?"
  - A: Manually dismiss it, or check that your action was logged in the timeline (email sent, call logged, etc.). Suggestions auto-dismiss when new activity is detected.

- Q: "Can MAIA auto-send emails based on suggestions?"
  - A: No—Smart Suggestions are alerts only. You decide whether to act. MAIA can draft, but you must review and send.
