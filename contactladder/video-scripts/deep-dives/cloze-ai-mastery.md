## How Cloze AI Actually Works (2 minutes)

[**Screen: Cloze home screen with AI suggestions**]

Let's start with what Cloze AI is doing behind the scenes.

**It's analyzing:**
- Every email you send and receive
- Every call you make
- Every meeting you attend
- How quickly you respond to different people
- Who you communicate with most
- Transaction patterns
- Communication frequency

**Then it's learning:**
- Who's important to your business
- When you typically follow up
- What triggers a sale
- Who's being neglected
- What patterns lead to deals

**And it's suggesting:**
- Who to reach out to today
- What to say
- When relationships are going stale
- Which deals need attention
- What tasks to prioritize

Think of it as having an assistant who's watched you work for years and knows exactly what you need to do next.

## Relationship Scoring Explained (2 minutes)

[**Screen: Contact profile showing relationship score**]

See this number? That's your relationship score with this person.

**Cloze scores 1-100 based on:**
- Communication frequency
- Recency of last contact
- Response rates
- Meeting history
- Deal history
- Email engagement

**What the scores mean:**

**90-100: VIP Relationship**
- Frequent contact
- High engagement
- Recent activity
- These are your A-list clients and hot leads

**70-89: Strong Relationship**
- Regular contact
- Good engagement
- Active relationship

**50-69: Moderate Relationship**
- Some contact
- Relationship exists but could be stronger

**Below 50: Weak or Stale Relationship**
- Little contact
- Low engagement
- Needs attention!

**Here's the powerful part:**
[**Screen: Filter contacts by score**]

You can filter your entire database by score to find who needs attention!

## "People to Reach Out To" Feature (2 minutes)

[**Screen: Home > People to Reach Out To section**]

This is Cloze AI's killer feature.

Every morning, Cloze shows you exactly who to contact today.

**How it decides:**
- You haven't talked to them in [X] days
- But you USED to talk every [Y] days
- Their relationship score is dropping
- They're important to your business (past client, lead, referral source)

**Example:**
[**Screen: Show specific person**]

"Sarah Johnson - Last contact 45 days ago, usually contact every 30 days"

Translation: You're overdue! Call Sarah today.

**Taking Action:**
Click the person > Quick actions:
- Send email (AI suggests what to say!)
- Schedule call
- Add reminder
- Remove from list (if not relevant)

Takes 2 minutes to work through this list every morning. Prevents relationships from going cold!

## AI-Suggested Actions (2 minutes)

[**Screen: Various AI suggestions**]

Cloze suggests actions in real-time:

**Email Arrived:**
"Important email from John Smith. Suggest reply within 2 hours."
Why? Because you typically reply to John quickly, and he's a VIP.

**Deal Stuck:**
"Property at 123 Main St has been in 'Under Contract' for 42 days. Average is 30 days. Suggest status update."
Cloze knows your typical closing timeline!

**Meeting Follow-up:**
"You met with Sarah yesterday. Suggest follow-up email summarizing next steps."

**Stale Relationship Alert:**
"Haven't contacted Mark Davis in 90 days. He was a client 2 years ago."
Re-engagement opportunity!

**Taking Action:**
- Click "Do It" - Takes suggested action
- Click "Snooze" - Remind me later
- Click "Dismiss" - Not relevant

**Communication Patterns:**
- "Frequent Contact"
- "VIP"
- "Stale Relationship"

**Deal History:**
- "Past Client"
- "Active Deal"
- "Lost Deal"

**Email Content:**
- Mentions "buyer" → Auto-tag "Buyer"

## AI Email Composition (2 minutes)

[**Screen: Compose email with AI assistant**]

Writing emails? Let AI help.

**Click "AI Assistant" when composing:**

You type:
"Need to follow up with Sarah about the property she saw yesterday"

AI suggests:
```
Subject: Following up on 123 Main Street

Hi Sarah,

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up after showing you 123 Main Street yesterday.

What did you think? I know the kitchen really caught your eye, and the backyard was perfect for your dogs.

If you're interested in moving forward, I'd recommend we submit an offer soon. Based on recent sales in the area, homes like this are averaging only 8 days on market.

Want to schedule a call to discuss next steps?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

Edit as needed, send!

**This is trained on YOUR writing style**
The more you use Cloze, the better it gets at sounding like you.

## Making AI Smarter for Your Business (2 minutes)

[**Screen: Settings > AI Preferences**]

Teach Cloze about YOUR business:

**Step 1: Set Your Priorities**
Tell Cloze who matters most:
- Past clients: High priority
- Active leads: High priority
- Cold leads: Medium priority
- Vendors: Low priority

**Step 2: Define Your Follow-up Cadence**
- Past clients: Contact every 90 days
- Active buyers: Contact every 7 days
- Active sellers: Contact every 3 days
- Sphere: Contact every 180 days

**Step 3: Customize Notifications**
What do you want AI to alert you about?
- ✅ VIP email arrives
- ✅ Deal hasn't been updated in 7 days
- ✅ Relationship score drops below 50
- 🔲 Any new email (too noisy!)

**Step 4: Train on Your Responses**
When AI suggests something:
- If you take action → It learns this works
- If you dismiss → It learns this doesn't work
- Over time, suggestions get more accurate

---

## AI-Powered Reminders (1 minute)

[**Screen: Reminders with AI timing**]

Instead of setting arbitrary reminders, use AI-powered ones:

**Traditional Reminder:**
"Follow up with John on Tuesday"

**AI Reminder:**
"Remind me to follow up with John if I haven't heard back in 3 days"

Cloze monitors your inbox! If John replies, reminder auto-cancels.

**Another example:**
"Remind me to check on this deal if status hasn't changed in 2 weeks"

Cloze watches the deal. Reminder only fires if needed!

## Common AI Mistakes to Avoid (1 minute)

**Mistake #1: Dismissing Everything**
If you constantly dismiss suggestions, AI stops learning. Give it a chance!

**Mistake #2: Not Setting Priorities**
AI doesn't know who's important unless you tell it. Use tags, scores, and preferences.

**Mistake #3: Ignoring Stale Relationship Alerts**
These are gold! Don't dismiss them. Act on them or adjust your follow-up cadence.

**Mistake #4: Not Connecting All Communication Channels**
AI needs complete data. Connect email, phone, calendar, and SMS.
