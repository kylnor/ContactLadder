## Understanding Templates vs Campaigns (2 minutes)

[**Screen: Split view showing Templates and Campaigns**]

First, let's clarify the difference:

**Templates** = Reusable content
- One-off emails you send repeatedly
- "Just Listed" announcements
- "Happy Birthday" messages
- Market updates

**Campaigns** = Automated sequences
- Series of emails sent on a schedule
- Buyer nurture sequences
- Seller follow-up series
- Post-closing stay-in-touch

Think: Templates are building blocks, Campaigns are the automation.

## Creating Your First Template (3 minutes)

[**Screen: Templates > New Template**]

Let's create a "Just Listed" template.

**Step 1: Click "New Template"**

**Step 2: Name Your Template**
Name it clearly: "Just Listed - Sphere Announcement"

**Step 3: Write Your Subject Line**
Use merge fields for personalization:
```
Just Listed: [Property Address] - [Price]
```

**Step 4: Design Your Email**
[**Screen: Email editor**]

Pro tip: Keep it simple and scannable:
- Headline with property address
- 2-3 key features (bullet points!)
- High-quality photo
- Call-to-action: "Schedule a showing"
- Your signature with photo

**Step 5: Add Merge Fields**
Click the merge fields dropdown:
- [Name] - Recipient's first name
- [Property.Address] - Property address
- [Property.Price] - List price
- [Agent.Name] - Your name
- [Agent.Phone] - Your phone

Example:
```
Hi [Name],

I just listed a beautiful home at [Property.Address] for [Property.Price].

This one won't last long!

Want to see it? Reply to schedule a private showing.

Best,
[Agent.Name]
```

**Step 6: Save Template**

Done! Now you can use this anytime you list a property.

**Email 2 - Day 2**
Subject: "Here's how the process works"
