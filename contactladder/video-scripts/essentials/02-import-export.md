## Preparing Your Import File (2 minutes)

[**Screen: Excel/Google Sheets with sample contact data**]

Before you import, let's prepare your data properly.

**Required Columns:**
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email Address

**Recommended Columns:**
- Phone Number
- Company
- Address
- Tags (separate with commas)

**Pro Tips:**
1. Clean up duplicate entries BEFORE importing
2. Standardize phone number formats (555-555-5555)
3. Add tags like "Past Client", "Lead", "Vendor"
4. Include source if you have it (Zillow, Realtor.com, etc.)

## Syncing from Other Platforms (2 minutes)

[**Screen: Settings > Integrations**]

You don't always need to import CSV files. Cloze can sync directly from:

**Google Contacts**
- Settings > Integrations > Google
- Authorize access
- Contacts sync automatically (both ways!)

**Microsoft Outlook/Office 365**
- Settings > Integrations > Microsoft
- Authorize access
- Syncs contacts and calendar

**Your Email Provider**
When you connect email, Cloze automatically creates contacts for anyone you email or who emails you.

This is powerful - it means your database grows organically!

## Avoiding Common Mistakes (1 minute)

[**Screen: Show examples**]

**Mistake #1: Not Using Tags During Import**
Always add an import tag! "Imported Jan 2025" helps you track where contacts came from.

**Mistake #2: Importing Before Cleaning Data**
Clean up your spreadsheet first. Remove duplicates, fix typos, standardize formats.

**Mistake #3: Not Mapping Custom Fields**
If you have custom data, create custom fields in Cloze FIRST, then map during import.

**Mistake #4: Forgetting to Merge Duplicates**
Always check "Merge with existing contacts" to avoid duplicates.

## Pro Tips (1 minute)

**Tip #1: Segment Your Imports**
Import in batches by type:
- Past clients first
- Active leads second
- Sphere of influence third

This makes it easier to tag and organize.

**Tip #2: Use Import Tags**
Tag everything! "2025 Import", "From Zillow", "KW Database"

**Tip #3: Test First**
Import 10 contacts first. Check they look right. Then import the rest.
