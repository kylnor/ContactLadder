## Understanding the AI Features (2 minutes)

[**Screen: Home view with AI suggestions**]

Here's where Cloze gets really powerful.

**See this section?** "People to reach out to"

Cloze is analyzing:
- When you last talked to someone
- How important they are (based on your history)
- Whether you typically follow up more frequently

It's literally telling you who to call or email today.

**And this section?** "Stale relationships"

These are people you used to communicate with regularly but haven't in a while. Perfect for re-engaging past clients!
