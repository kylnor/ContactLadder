## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### Before Your First Recording
1. **Read the script 3 times** - Get comfortable with the flow
2. **Practice the first 2 minutes** - Opening is hardest
3. **Don't memorize** - Scripts are guides, speak naturally
4. **Accept imperfection** - First video won't be perfect, that's OK!

### While Recording
1. **Speak slower than normal** - Viewers need time to process
2. **Pause between sections** - Makes editing easier
3. **Mess ups are fine** - Pause 3 seconds, start the sentence again
4. **Show, don't tell** - Demonstrate features on screen

### After Recording
1. **Edit same day** - While it's fresh in your mind
2. **Keep it simple** - Trim mistakes, add intro/outro, done!
3. **Upload and move on** - Don't obsess over perfection
4. **One video at a time** - Celebrate each completion!

## ❓ Common Questions

### "I've never recorded a video before!"
Neither have most successful course creators! The scripts guide you through exactly what to say and show. First video is awkward, but by video #3 you'll be comfortable.

### "What if I mess up while recording?"
Pause for 3 seconds, then start that sentence again. You'll cut out mistakes in editing. Pro tip: Every good video has dozens of edited cuts!

### "How long will this take?"
- Per video: 1-2 hours (recording + editing + uploading)
- All 21 videos: 21-42 hours total
- Spread over 4-6 weeks = very manageable!

### "What equipment do I need?"
Start minimal:
- Computer you already have
- Built-in microphone (or $30 USB mic)
- Free screen recording software

Upgrade later if you want, but start now with what you have!

### "Can I use my own examples instead of the script?"
YES! Scripts are guides. Your real-world experience makes videos better. Add your personality!

### "Do videos need to be perfect?"
No! Authentic and helpful > polished and boring. Real agents want to learn from real experience, not a corporate training video.
