### Recording Tips

**Before you hit record:**
- [ ] Take 3 deep breaths
- [ ] Smile (it affects your voice!)
- [ ] Do a 10-second test recording
- [ ] Check audio levels one more time

**While recording:**
- **Pace yourself** - Speak 10% slower than feels natural
- **Pause between sections** - Makes editing easier
- **Mess up? No problem!** - Pause 3 seconds, start the sentence again

- **Energy** - Match the script's energy level

**Recording workflow:**
1. Start recording
2. Count to 3 in silence
3. Begin speaking
4. Record entire module without stopping
5. If you mess up, pause 3 seconds, start that section again
6. Don't stop for small mistakes - fix in editing
7. When done, pause 3 seconds, stop recording

### After Recording

**Immediate:**
1. Save project file (don't close software yet!)
2. Listen back to first 2-3 minutes
3. Audio good? Video clear? Proceed to edit!
4. Audio bad? Re-record before you forget your flow

**Editing checklist:**
- [ ] Trim silence at beginning/end
- [ ] Cut out long pauses and mistakes
- [ ] Add intro slide (5 seconds): Module title
- [ ] Add outro slide (5 seconds): "Next Module: [Name]"

## Troubleshooting

### "My audio sounds echoey"
- Record in smaller room
- Add soft materials (blankets, pillows)
- Get closer to microphone (6-8 inches)

### "I keep messing up words"
- Slow down!
- Have water nearby
- Take breaks every 10 minutes
- Don't aim for perfection - natural is better

### "Recording feels awkward"
- Practice the first 2 minutes 3 times before recording
- Pretend you're teaching a friend
- Smile while talking (really helps!)
- First few videos are always awkward - push through!

### "Videos are too large"
- Export settings: H.264 codec, 8-10 Mbps bitrate
- 15-minute video should be ~600-900 MB
- If over 2 GB, lower bitrate or resolution

### "Don't know what to show on screen"
- Follow the [**Screen: ...**] cues in script
- Show exactly what you're describing
- Zoom in on small UI elements
- Pause 2 seconds after each click
