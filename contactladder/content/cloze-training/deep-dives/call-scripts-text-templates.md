## MODULE 3.7: CALL SCRIPTS & TEXT TEMPLATES

### Standardize Your Communication for Consistency & Speed

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

**Hook:** Same calls 50x/year. Scripts hit every point. Templates give you the right message in seconds. No more blanking on what to say!

**Story:**

> "Winged 8x8 calls. Forgot referral asks. Rambled. Created 5-question script. Completion rate: 60% to 95%."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

### Call Scripts vs Text Templates

| Feature | Call Scripts | Text Templates |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | Structure phone conversations | Speed up text messaging |
| **Format** | Question/response flow | Pre-written messages |
| **Flexibility** | Use as guide, adapt live | Use as-is or customize |
| **Best For** | Complex conversations (consultations) | Quick responses, confirmations |

**Use Scripts For:** 8x8 check-ins, buyer consultations, seller CMAs, annual reviews, FSBO/expired calls

**Use Text Templates For:** Showing confirmations, quick responses, appointment scheduling, property alerts

**Why this matters:** You've got 40 hours a week. Spend them building relationships, not staring at your phone wondering what to type. Templates save 10 minutes per day. Scripts keep you on track."

## SECTION 1: CREATING CALL SCRIPTS

**HOW to Build Effective Scripts (Video - 4-5 min)**

### Script Structure (3-Part Framework)

**1. OPENING (10-15 seconds)**
- Identify yourself
- State purpose
- Get permission to continue

**2. BODY (1-3 minutes)**
- Ask questions
- Provide value
- Address concerns

**3. CLOSING (15-30 seconds)**
- Summarize next steps
- Set expectations
- Thank them

**The result:** Every call hits your goals. No awkward pauses. No forgotten asks. Just consistent, professional conversations!"

### Example: 8x8 Check-In Script

```
OPENING:
"Hi [Name], it's [Your Name] with [Brokerage]. How are you?

I'm doing my monthly check-ins with my favorite people. Got 2 minutes?"

[Wait for yes]

BODY:
1. "How's everything going with you and [Spouse/Family]?"
   [Listen, respond authentically]

2. "How's the house treating you? Anything need fixing or updating?"
   [Listen for pain points]

3. "Real estate market has been [interesting/crazy/busy] lately.
    Do you know anyone thinking about buying or selling?"
   [Referral ask]

4. "I'm always here if you need contractor recommendations,
    market updates, or just want to grab coffee. Sound good?"
   [Reinforce availability]

CLOSING:
"Perfect! I'll check in again in a month or two. You have my number
 if anything comes up. Thanks for the time, [Name]!"

[End call warmly]
```

**Time:** 2-3 minutes total

### Example: Buyer Consultation Script

```
OPENING:
"Hi [Name], thanks for meeting with me. I want to understand exactly
 what you're looking for so I can help you find the perfect home.
 I've got about 10 questions - should take 15 minutes. Sound good?"

BODY - QUALIFYING QUESTIONS:
1. Budget: "What's your comfortable price range?"
2. Pre-approval: "Have you talked to a lender yet?"
3. Timeline: "When are you hoping to move in?"
4. Must-haves: "What are your non-negotiables?"
5. Nice-to-haves: "What would be nice but you could live without?"
6. Location: "Which areas are you considering?"
7. Home type: "Single-family, condo, townhome preference?"
8. Decision-makers: "Who's involved in the decision?"
9. Motivation: "What's driving the move?"
10. Concerns: "What worries you most about buying?"

BODY - VALUE PROPOSITION:
"Here's how I work with buyers:
- I'll send you listings that match your criteria
- We'll tour properties on your schedule
- I'll handle all negotiations and paperwork
- You don't pay me - the seller does
- My goal: Find you the right home, not just any home"

CLOSING:
"Let's get you set up on property alerts. I'll send you listings
 this week. What days work best for showings?"

[Schedule next steps]
```

**Time:** 15-20 minutes

## SECTION 3: BEST PRACTICES

### Do's and Don'ts

**CALL SCRIPTS:**

✅ **DO:** Use as guide, practice, adapt, listen more, end with next steps

❌ **DON'T:** Sound robotic, rush, ignore responses, pitch too early, skip closing

**TEXT TEMPLATES:**

✅ **DO:** Personalize, keep under 160 characters, use correct grammar, include CTA, respond quickly

❌ **DON'T:** Send walls of text, overuse emojis (1-2 max), use for sensitive topics, text after 9pm

### When to Customize vs Use Template

**Use Template AS-IS:**
- Appointment confirmations
- "Got it" acknowledgments
- Standard scheduling questions

**Customize Template:**
- Emotional situations (offer rejected, deal fell through)
- Complex questions
- Personal conversations
- First contact with new lead
