## SECTION 1: EMAIL OPEN TRACKING

### Know Exactly When Someone Opens Your Message

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Never tracked opens | "Did they get my email? Did they read it? Should I follow up? Open tracking answers these questions instantly." |
| B | Used tracking elsewhere | "You know tracking works. Cloze does it automatically for every email you send - no special links, no extra steps." |
| C | Skeptical of privacy | "Some agents feel weird about tracking. Here's the thing: your competitors are doing it, and it helps you serve clients better by knowing when they're engaged." |

**Story to include:**

> "Sent CMA, no response. Checked. Opened 7x in 2 days. Called: 'Questions about the CMA?' Stunned I knew. Listed that week. $18K commission from one tracking insight!"

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

### How Email Open Tracking Works

**The Technology:**
- Cloze embeds an invisible 1x1 pixel image in emails
- When recipient opens email, the pixel loads
- Cloze records the open event
- Shows you: date, time, and device used

**What You Can See:**

| Information | Example | What It Tells You |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| **If opened** | ✅ Opened | They received and read it |
| **When opened** | Jan 15, 9:23 AM | Best time to follow up |
| **How many times** | Opened 5 times | High interest/engagement |
| **Device** | iPhone, Desktop | How they prefer to read email |
| **Location** (sometimes) | Las Vegas, NV | Confirms they're local/traveling |

**What You CAN'T See:**
- How long they read it
- If they read the whole email
- If they forwarded it (you'll see if forwardee opens it)

**Important Notes:**

⚠️ **Limitations:**
- Requires images enabled in email client (most do by default)
- Gmail pre-loads images = may show false opens
- Some privacy tools block tracking
- Not 100% accurate, but directionally reliable

✅ **Privacy:**
- Cloze doesn't share that you're tracking
- Industry-standard practice
- No personal info collected beyond open event

**When Opens Tell You to Act:**

| Scenario | What It Means | Action |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| **Opened immediately** | Urgent interest | Follow up soon (within hours) |
| **Opened 3+ times** | Highly engaged, may have questions | Call to offer help |
| **Opened once, days ago** | Read but not ready | Gentle follow-up in a week |
| **Never opened** | Missed it, wrong email, not interested | Try different approach (text/call) |
| **Opened 10+ times** | Shared with others or analyzing deeply | Major interest - prioritize |

**Why this matters:** You've got 40 hours a week. Stop guessing who's interested. Let the data tell you where to focus your time!

**HOW (Video - 3-4 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

### Part 1: Verify Tracking is Enabled

1. **Go to Settings → Mail Settings**
2. **Find "Email Open Tracking"**
3. **Ensure it's ENABLED** (should be on by default)
4. **Save if changed**

**Result:** All future emails will track opens

### Part 2: See If Someone Opened Your Email

**Method 1 - From Timeline:**

1. **Open a contact** (e.g., Mike Thompson)
2. **Scroll to Timeline**
3. **Find email you sent**
4. **Look for indicator:**
   - 👁️ **"Opened"** with timestamp
   - OR "Not opened yet"
5. **Click email** → See detailed open history:
   - Opened 3 times
   - Jan 15 @ 9:23 AM (iPhone)
   - Jan 15 @ 3:45 PM (Desktop)
   - Jan 16 @ 8:10 AM (iPhone)

**Method 2 - From Sent Email:**

1. **Go to your email (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)**
2. **Find email in Sent folder**
3. **Cloze shows open status** in your email client (if Cloze extension installed)

**Method 3 - MAIA Query:**

1. **Open MAIA**
2. **Ask:** "Has Mike Thompson opened my email?"
3. **MAIA responds:** "Mike opened your email 3 times, most recently yesterday at 3:45 PM"

### Part 3: Filter by Email Opens

**Scenario:** Find everyone who opened your newsletter but didn't respond

1. **Create Audience:**
   - Opened email: "January Market Update" (if  filter by subject)
   - AND Did not reply
2. **Result:** List of engaged but silent contacts
3. **Action:** Follow-up call or email

**Note:** Audience filtering by email opens may be limited - check Cloze capabilities

## SECTION 2: LINK CLICK TRACKING

### Know What They're Interested In

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

**Hook:** "You send 5 listings. They click 2 of them. Now you know which properties interest them. Without asking. Without guessing. The result: Laser-focused follow-up that actually converts!"

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

### How Click Tracking Works

**The Technology:**
- Cloze wraps links in tracking URLs
- When recipient clicks, Cloze records the event
- Shows you: which link, when clicked, how many times

**What You Can Track:**

| Link Type | Example | What You Learn |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Property Listings** | MLS link, virtual tour | Which properties interest them |
| **Documents** | CMA PDF, market report | If they reviewed your materials |
| **Scheduling Links** | Calendly, showing times | When they're booking appointments |
| **Website Links** | Your bio page, blog post | What content engages them |

**Use Cases:**

**Buyer Emails:**
- Send 5 listings
- Track which ones they click
- Follow up on those specific properties

**Seller Emails:**
- Send CMA with 3 comparable sales links
- See which comps they reviewed
- Discuss those in next conversation

**Newsletter:**
- Include 3 blog posts
- Track which topics get most clicks
- Create more content on popular topics

**HOW (Video - 2-3 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

### Part 1: Enable Click Tracking

1. **Settings → Mail Settings**
2. **Find "Link Click Tracking"**
3. **Enable**
4. **Save**

### Part 2: See Link Clicks

1. **Open contact timeline**
2. **Find email with links**
3. **Click to expand**
4. **See click events:**
   - "Clicked: 123 Maple St listing"
   - "Jan 15 @ 2:30 PM"

### Part 3: Use Click Data for Follow-Up

**Example Workflow:**

1. **Send buyer 5 listings via email**
2. **Wait 24 hours**
3. **Check Cloze:**
   - Mike clicked 2 listings: 123 Maple St and 456 Oak Ave
   - Opened email 3 times
4. **Follow-up call:**
   - "Hi Mike, I saw you checked out the house on Maple Street. Want to schedule a showing?"

**Result:** Mike thinks you're psychic. You're just tracking engagement. Boom!

**WHAT IF (Text)**

**Q: "Do recipients know their clicks are being tracked?"**
- A: No. The links look normal. Tracking is invisible. (This is standard practice in email marketing and sales.)

**Q: "What if link tracking breaks the link?"**
- A: Rare, but if it happens, disable click tracking for that email or use untracked links.

**Q: "Can I see WHO clicked a link in a mail merge?"**
- A: Yes! Each recipient's clicks appear on their individual timeline.

**Q: "What if someone clicks a link multiple times?"**
- A: All clicks are recorded with timestamps. Multiple clicks = high interest.

## SECTION 3: EMAIL SIGNATURES

### Professional Branding in Every Email

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | No signature / inconsistent | "Every email is a marketing opportunity. Your signature should include your name, title, phone, email, website, and social links. Consistently, every time. The result: Free advertising in every message you send!" |
| B | Basic signature | "You have 'Sent from my iPhone' as your signature. That's not professional. A real signature builds credibility and makes it easy for clients to contact you. Takes 5 minutes to set up, works forever." |
| C | Has good signature | "You have a signature. But do you have MULTIPLE signatures for different contexts? Buyer emails vs. seller emails vs. personal outreach? Here's where it gets good!" |

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

### What Makes a Great Email Signature

**Essential Elements:**

```
[Your Name]
[Your Title] | [Brokerage Name]
[Phone Number] (clickable call link)
[Email Address]
[Website URL]
[Social Media Icons/Links]
```

**Advanced Elements:**

```

2. **Name them clearly:** "Professional", "Personal", "Mobile"
3. **When composing email:**

   - Select appropriate signature
4. **Set default:** Choose which signature auto-loads

**Mobile Signatures:**

**iOS/Android Cloze App:**
1. **Settings → Mail Settings**

3. **Enter minimal signature**
4. **Save**

**Result:** Mobile emails auto-use mobile signature

### Part 3: Signature Best Practices

**✅ DO:** Under 100 words, clickable links, professional headshot, license number (if required), test both platforms, update regularly

**❌ DON'T:** Multiple fonts/colors, giant images, quotes, fake "Sent from iPhone", every certification

**Legal Requirements:**

Check your state and brokerage requirements:
- **License number required?** (Some states mandate this)
- **Equal Housing Opportunity logo?** (May be required)
- **MLS disclaimers?** (If sending MLS data)
- **Broker name/info?** (Some brokerages require)

## SECTION 4: AUTO-GREETINGS

### Personalize Based on Time of Day

**WHY (Video - 1-2 min)**

**Hook:** "Sending an email at 8am? 'Good morning!' Sending at 6pm? 'Good evening!' Auto-greetings do this for you. On autopilot!"

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

### How Auto-Greetings Work

**Cloze can automatically insert:**
- Good morning (before noon)
- Good afternoon (noon - 5pm)
- Good evening (after 5pm)

**Example:**

**You write:**
```
{{Greeting}} Mike,

Just wanted to follow up on the showing yesterday...
```

**Recipient sees (sent at 9am):**
```
Good morning Mike,

Just wanted to follow up on the showing yesterday...
```

**Recipient sees (sent at 7pm):**
```
Good evening Mike,

Just wanted to follow up on the showing yesterday...
```

**HOW to Enable Auto-Greetings:**

1. **Settings → Mail Settings**
2. **Find "Auto-Greetings"**
3. **Enable**
4. **Choose style:**
   - Formal: "Good morning"
   - Casual: "Hey" / "Hi"
   - Custom: Define your own
5. **Save**

**Using in Emails:**

1. **Compose email**
2. **Type:** `{{Greeting}}` or use autocomplete
3. **Cloze replaces with appropriate greeting**
4. **Send**

**When to Use:**

✅ **Good for:**
- Follow-up emails
- Check-ins
- Professional correspondence
- Mass emails (mail merge)

❌ **Skip for:**
- Replies to ongoing thread (weird to say "Good morning" at 10pm in a reply)
- Extremely time-sensitive urgent emails
- International recipients (time zones)

**WHAT IF (Text)**

**Q: "What if I send an email at 11:59pm - will it say 'Good evening'?"**
- A: Yes. Might want to schedule send for morning instead if it's not urgent.

**Q: "Can I customize the greetings?"**
- A: Yes, in Mail Settings  define custom greetings or disable entirely.

**Q: "What if recipient is in different time zone?"**
- A: Greeting is based on YOUR send time, not their receipt time. For international contacts, skip auto-greetings.

## SECTION 5: PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

### Email Tracking + Signatures Workflow

### Workflow 1: New Lead Email w/ Tracking

**Scenario:** Zillow lead comes in

1. **Compose email to lead**
2. **Select "Professional - Full" signature**
3. **Include links:**
   - Link to your bio page
   - Link to buyer guide PDF
   - Link to schedule call (Calendly)
4. **Send**
5. **24 hours later:**
   - Check if they opened (timeline)
   - Check which links they clicked
6. **Follow-up based on behavior:**
   - Clicked buyer guide? Call: "Saw you downloaded the buyer guide - questions?"
   - Clicked calendar link but didn't book? Text: "Happy to jump on a call anytime - my calendar link is [URL]"
   - Didn't open? Try different approach (text or call)

### Workflow 2: Listing Email to Buyers w/ Click Tracking

**Scenario:** Send 5 listings to buyer

1. **Compose email**
2. **Include 5 MLS listing links**
3. **Send**
4. **Track which listings they click**
5. **Follow-up:**
   - "Hi Sarah, I saw you checked out the home on Maple Street - want to schedule a showing this weekend?"

### Workflow 3: CMA Email to Seller w/ Open Tracking

**Scenario:** Send CMA to prospective seller

1. **Email CMA PDF attachment**
2. **Include links to comps**
3. **Send with professional signature**
4. **Monitor opens:**
   - Opened 1 time = read it
   - Opened 5+ times = analyzing, may have questions
5. **Follow-up timing:**
   - Opened immediately + multiple times = call same day
   - Opened once, days ago = follow up in 2-3 days
   - Never opened = try calling instead

## COMPLETION

**You just mastered Email Tracking & Signatures!**

**Here's what you unlocked:**

✅ Email open tracking that shows exactly when they read your message
✅ See when someone opens your emails (and how many times)
✅ Link click tracking that reveals real engagement
✅ Create professional email signatures that build credibility
✅ Multiple signatures for different contexts
✅ Auto-greetings for personalization on autopilot
✅ Combine tracking and signatures for better follow-up

**That's 3+ hours saved per week.** No more guessing who's interested. No more follow-ups with cold leads while hot prospects go ignored. No more "Sent from my iPhone" amateur signatures. Just data-driven follow-up that converts. One agent tracked 7 opens on a CMA, called at the perfect time, and closed $18K in commission. That's the power of knowing.

**Next steps:** Enable tracking, create professional signature, create 2-3 variations, test on both platforms, practice with tracking data

**Pro Tips:** Open tracking equals when to follow up, click tracking equals what interests them, multiple signatures equal flexibility, signature equals marketing, update quarterly

Time to turn email into your secret weapon!
