## MODULE TC1: THE CLOZE LIBRARY

### Your Central Hub for All Templates

**WHY (Video - 3-4 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Rewrites emails constantly | "You've written your buyer intro email 47 times. Each version is slightly different. Some are great. Some are meh. Save your best version in the Library and use it forever." |
| B | Inconsistent team messaging | "Your three buyer agents all send different intro emails. Templates in the Library ensure everyone uses the same professional message." |
| C | Can't find past emails | "You wrote the perfect market update email 6 months ago. Where is it? If it was in the Library, it would be one click away, ready to reuse." |

**Story to include:**

> "Spent 5 minutes hunting through my Sent folder for old emails. Every single time. Started using Library. Now 25 templates. One click, personalize, send. Never search again. Those 5 minutes became 10 seconds!"

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**What Is the Cloze Library?**

The Library is **your central place to create and manage all types of templates.** Think of it as your email template storage, content hub, and campaign builder all in one.

**What You Can Store in the Library:**

| Template Type | What It Is | Use Case |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| **Personal Email** | One-to-one email templates | Intro email, follow-up, check-in |
| **Marketing Email** | Designed, image-rich newsletters | Market update, event invitation |
| **Text Message** | SMS templates | Quick check-in, showing reminder |
| **Call Script** | Talking points for calls | Buyer consultation agenda, listing pitch |
| **Campaign** | Automated drip sequences | 8x8 program, buyer nurture, seller follow-up |
| **Article** | Reusable content pieces | Blog posts, market insights |
| **Snippet** | Small reusable elements | Email signatures, disclaimers, images |

**Organization Features:**

- **Categories:** Group templates by type (Buyers, Sellers, Marketing, Holidays, etc.)
- **Tags:** Add keywords for easy searching (#justlisted, #followup, #newsletter)
- **Team Sharing:** Share templates with team members (if you're a team admin)
- **Personal Copies:** Copy team templates and customize for your own use

**Why Use the Library?**

1. **Consistency:** Your best messages, every time
2. **Speed:** One click loads a template vs. rewriting from scratch

## MODULE TC2: EMAIL TEMPLATES

### Save Your Best Messages

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Wastes time rewriting | "You've sent the same 'Thank you for the referral' email 20 times this year. Five minutes each time. That's 100 minutes rewriting the same email. Templates turn 5 minutes into 30 seconds. Get those 100 minutes back!" |
| B | Forgets to include key info | "Sometimes your intro email mentions your website and social media. Sometimes you forget. Templates ensure you never leave out important details. Every client gets complete information. Every single time." |
| C | Wants professional polish | "Your 9am emails are eloquent. Your 9pm emails when you're exhausted are mediocre. Templates give you A-game messaging even when you're running on fumes. The result: Professional polish 24/7." |

**Story to include:**

> "Created 'Just Sold' template. Photo, address, CTA. Every closing: drop in details, send. Takes 2 minutes. Now every closing gets professional announcement. Used to forget half the time. Now it happens automatically. 30+ closings per year, that's an hour saved!"

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**Types of Email Templates:**

| Template Type | When to Use | Example Subject Lines |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Personal Email** | One-to-one, from your inbox | "Great meeting you yesterday!" |
| **Marketing Email** | Designed newsletters, image-rich | "Your December Market Update" |

**Personal Email Templates:**

- Plain text or simple HTML

**Marketing Email Templates:**

- Fully designed, image-rich layouts
- Responsive (looks great on mobile and desktop)
- Can include photos, buttons, multiple sections
- Best for newsletters, event invitations, or branded content
- Requires Cloze Business Platinum Plan

**Essential Templates Every Agent Should Have:**

| Template Name | Type | Purpose |
|--------------|------|---------|
| **Intro Email** | Personal | First touchpoint with new contact |
| **Buyer Guide Email** | Personal | Send buyer guide PDF |
| **Lender Referral** | Personal | Introduce preferred lenders |

**HOW to Create an Email Template (Video - 4-5 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

**Example: Creating a "Thank You for Referral" Template**

1. Go to Library → Tap the + icon
2. Select "Personal Email Template"
3. Fill in details:
   - **Name:** "Thank You for Referral"
   - **Category:** "Advocates"
   - **Tags:** #thankyou, #referral

4. Write the template:

Subject: Thank you for the referral!

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to personally thank you for referring [Referral Name] to me. Your trust means the world, and I promise to take great care of them.

Thanks again—you're the best!

[Your Name]
[Your Phone]
[Your Email]
```

5. Use placeholders:
   - [First Name] → Auto-fills with contact's first name

   - [Your Name] → Your signature

6. Save to Library

**Using the Template:**

1. Contact refers someone to you
2. Go to their contact record
3. Click "Email" → Select "Use Template"
4. Choose "Thank You for Referral"
5. Template loads with their first name auto-filled
6. Fill in [Referral Name]: "Sarah Johnson"
7. Add a personal line: "I already reached out to her and we're meeting for coffee Thursday!"
8. Send

**Pro Tip:**

> "Create templates for any email you've sent twice. If you've written it before, template it. Save once. Use forever. Done."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "Can I include attachments?"
  - A: Add note: "[Attach buyer guide]." Can't pre-attach files.

- Q: "Customize before sending?"
  - A: Always. Templates are starting points.

## MODULE TC3: UNDERSTANDING CAMPAIGNS

### Automated Drip Sequences That Run on Autopilot

**WHY (Video - 3-4 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Manually follows up with leads | "You get a new lead. You email them. Three days later you forget to follow up. They go cold. Campaigns send the follow-ups automatically. Set it once. It runs forever. Never lose a lead to forgetfulness again!" |
| B | Inconsistent nurture | "Some leads get 8 touches. Some get 2. It depends on how busy you are that week. Campaigns ensure every lead gets the same VIP experience. Automatically. Every single time. No exceptions." |
| C | Wants to scale without hiring | "You can only handle so many manual follow-ups. Campaigns let you nurture 100 leads with the same effort it used to take to nurture 10. The result: Scale without hiring, without working longer hours." |

**Story to include:**

> "Used to manually send 8x8. Forget. Get busy. Skip weeks. By week 4, I'd lose track completely. Now tag #8x8, campaign runs automatically. Eight emails over 8 weeks. Perfect timing. I respond when they reply. Campaign pauses. Relationship happens. Boom!"

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**What Is a Campaign?**

A Campaign is **an automated sequence of emails, texts, tasks, and actions** that runs based on triggers and timing you set. Think of it as a workflow that Cloze executes for you.

**Campaign Types:**

| Type | What It Does | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **One-to-One Personal** | Individual drip sequences | Lead nurture, buyer/seller follow-up |
| **One-to-One Property** | Property-specific automation | Listing marketing, buyer property alerts |
| **One-to-Many Nurture Blast** | Mass nurture, one-time or recurring | Monthly newsletter, holiday greetings |
| **One-to-Many Property Blast** | Property announcement to many | Just Listed, Open House, Price Reduction |

**How Campaigns Work:**

```
TRIGGER:
Contact gets tagged #8x8
   ↓
CAMPAIGN STARTS:
Email 1 sent immediately
   ↓
WAIT:
7 days
   ↓
Email 2 sent automatically
   ↓
WAIT:
7 days
   ↓
Email 3 sent automatically
   ↓
(Continues through all steps)
   ↓
CAMPAIGN ENDS:
Contact moves to next Segment or gets new tag
```

**Campaign Step Types:**

| Step Type | What It Does | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Communicate** | Auto-send email or text | Send Touch 1 email |
| **Wait** | Pause for duration, inactivity, or task completion | Wait 7 days |
| **Take Action** | Create to-do, send alert | Remind me to call if they reply |
| **Change** | Modify tags or custom fields | Add #nurtured tag when complete |
| **Branch** | Route based on tags, segments, fields | If buyer → send buyer content, if seller → send seller content |
| **Repeat** | Loop back to earlier step | Send monthly newsletter forever |
| **End** | Stop the campaign | Campaign complete |

**Smart Features:**

- **Pause on Activity:** If contact replies, campaign pauses (you're in conversation)
- **Pause on Meeting:** If meeting scheduled, campaign pauses (relationship is active)
- **Resume After Inactivity:** Campaign resumes if no contact for X days
- **Branch Logic:** Send different messages based on contact attributes

**Key Insight:**

> "Campaigns aren't 'set it and forget it.' They're 'set it and let it run while you focus on conversations.' If someone replies to Email 2, YOU respond personally. The campaign pauses. When the conversation ends, the campaign can resume or you manually stop it. Why this matters: You've got 40 hours a week. Stop spending them remembering who needs what email. Let Cloze handle timing while you handle relationships."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "Campaign vs Next Steps?"
  - A: Next Steps are manual checklists. Campaigns automate sequences.

- Q: "Multiple campaigns per contact?"
  - A: Yes, but avoid overwhelming them with emails.

- Q: "Stop campaign for one contact?"
  - A: Remove tag or opt out manually.

- Q: "Send SMS?"
  - A: Yes if text messaging enabled.

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |

| A | Overwhelmed by campaign building | "You know you need a buyer nurture campaign but writing 6 emails feels like homework. AI Ghostwriter creates the entire campaign—emails, timing, everything—in under 30 seconds." |
| B | Not a great writer | "You're better at conversations than writing emails. Ghostwriter writes professional, engaging emails based on your goal. You tweak if needed." |

**Story to include:**

> "Wanted past client annual review campaign. Told Ghostwriter my goal. 30 seconds later: complete campaign, 6 emails, perfect timing. Tweaked one line, launched. Best campaign I ever ran. Barely wrote a word. The result: 45 past clients got consistent annual check-ins. Zero manual work!"

## MODULE TC6: CAMPAIGN TYPES & USE CASES

### One-to-One vs. One-to-Many

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Confused about campaign types | "You've got leads to nurture, listings to market, and newsletters to send. Each needs a different campaign type. Let's break down which type to use when." |
| B | Wants to automate everything | "One-to-One campaigns nurture individual relationships. One-to-Many campaigns reach your whole database. Use both and you've got complete automation." |
| C | Wastes time on repetitive tasks | "You're sending the same 'price reduction' email to 50 buyers manually. One-to-Many campaigns send it once, deliver to everyone, track engagement automatically." |

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**The Four Campaign Types:**

### 1. ONE-TO-ONE PERSONAL

**What It Is:** Individual drip sequences triggered by tags or segments

**How It Works:**
- Each contact gets the campaign individually
- Feels personal (one person's journey through the sequence)
- Pauses on activity (reply, meeting)
- Customizable per contact

**Use Cases:**
- Lead nurture (8x8 program)
- Buyer education sequence
- Seller listing preparation
- Past client annual review
- Re-engagement of cold leads

**Example Trigger:** Tag = #leadnurture, Segment = SOI

---

### 2. ONE-TO-ONE PROPERTY

**What It Is:** Property-specific automation for individual buyers

**How It Works:**
- Tied to a specific property in your Properties tab
- Sends property updates, showing reminders, follow-ups
- Tracks buyer interest in that property
- Ends when property status changes (sold, off-market)

**Use Cases:**
- Buyer interest nurture for a listing
- Property showing follow-up sequence
- Open house invitation and reminders
- Price reduction alerts to interested buyers

**Example Trigger:** Buyer tagged #interested in Property 123 Main St

---

### 3. ONE-TO-MANY NURTURE BLAST

**What It Is:** Mass email sent to many people at once (one-time or recurring)

**How It Works:**
- You select an audience (Segment, View, Tag)
- Everyone receives the same email at the same time
- Can be one-time (holiday greeting) or recurring (monthly newsletter)
- Tracks opens and clicks for the group

**Use Cases:**
- Monthly market update newsletter
- Holiday greeting (Thanksgiving, New Year)
- Client appreciation event invitation
- Quarterly check-in to past clients
- Re-engagement blast to cold database

**Example Trigger:** Send to Segment = Past Client, recurring monthly

---

### 4. ONE-TO-MANY PROPERTY BLAST

**What It Is:** Property announcement sent to multiple contacts at once

**How It Works:**
- Tied to a specific property
- Sent to an audience (matched buyers, database, segment)
- One-time send when property event happens
- Tracks engagement per property

**Use Cases:**
- Just Listed announcement
- Open House invitation
- Price Reduction alert
- Back on Market notification
- Just Sold announcement

**Example Trigger:** Property status = Active, send to Tag = #summerlincustomers

---

**Comparison Table:**

| Campaign Type | Frequency | Feels Like | Best For |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **One-to-One Personal** | Ongoing sequence | Personal drip | Individual nurture |
| **One-to-One Property** | Ongoing per property | Property-specific follow-up | Buyer property interest |
| **One-to-Many Nurture** | One-time or recurring | Newsletter/blast | Database nurture |
| **One-to-Many Property** | One-time per event | Property announcement | Listing marketing |

**HOW to Choose the Right Campaign Type (Video - 3-4 min)**

*Screen recording showing decision tree:*

**Decision Tree:**

1. **Is this about a specific property?**
   - Yes → Property Campaign (One-to-One or One-to-Many)
   - No → Personal/Nurture Campaign

2. **Is this for one person or many?**
   - One person → One-to-One
   - Many people → One-to-Many

3. **Is this a sequence or a one-time send?**
   - Sequence (multiple emails over time) → One-to-One Personal
   - One-time (or recurring same email) → One-to-Many Nurture

4. **When does it send?**
   - Triggered by tag/segment → One-to-One
   - Sent manually or on schedule → One-to-Many

**Examples:**

- **8x8 Program:** One-to-One Personal (individual sequence, triggered by tag)

- **Just Listed Announcement:** One-to-Many Property Blast (one-time, sent when listing goes active)
