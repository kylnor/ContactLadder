|---------|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Purpose** | Track real estate listings & transactions | Track business opportunities & partnerships | Track initiatives, campaigns, events |
| **Examples** | Buyer transaction, listing, property showing | Referral partnership, investor syndication, commercial deal | Open house event, marketing campaign, team project |
| **Timeline** | Transaction-based (contract to close) | Opportunity-based (prospect to closed) | Project-based (start to completion) |
