## COURSE OVERVIEW

**Goal:** Get agents to consistently complete 10 contacts per day and check their Agenda twice daily.

**Structure:** Modular assembly based on intake chat. Each module follows 4MAT (WHY → WHAT → HOW → WHAT IF).

**Personalization carries through:**
- Agent's name
- GCI goal
- Average sale price
- Current contact count (estimated)
- Calculated "magic number" (contacts needed to hit goal)
- Connection status (email, phone, calendar)

---

## MODULE 0: FOUNDATIONS (Conditional - based on intake)

*This module appears first if intake reveals email/phone are not connected. If already connected, skip to Module 1.*

### 0A: Connect Your Email

**WHY (Video - 1-2 min)**
| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | New to Cloze | "Cloze is only as smart as the information you give it. Right now, it's blind - it doesn't know who you talk to or how often. Let's fix that." |
| B | Has Cloze, not using | "You've had Cloze sitting there, but it's been working with one hand tied behind its back. Once we connect your email, it starts seeing patterns you'd never catch yourself." |
| C | Frustrated/overwhelmed | "I know Cloze feels like a lot. Here's the thing - connecting your email actually makes it EASIER, not harder. It does the tracking work for you." |

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**
- Cloze reads your email metadata (who, when, how often)
- Does NOT read content unless you want it to
- Builds relationship strength automatically
- Pulls in contacts you've forgotten about
- Works with Gmail, Outlook/365, Exchange, iCloud

**HOW (Video - 2-3 min)**
- Screen recording: Settings → Connected Accounts → Add Email
- Show both Gmail and Outlook paths
- Note: "Takes up to an hour for initial sync"

**WHAT IF (Text)**
- Q: "What if I have multiple email addresses?"
  - A: Connect all of them. More data = smarter Cloze.
- Q: "What if I don't want Cloze reading my personal emails?"
  - A: You can set certain addresses to "redact" content while still tracking the contact.
- Q: "What if I use a shared team email?"
  - A: Connect your personal business email first. Team emails are an Advanced topic.

---

### 0B: Sync Your Phone

**WHY (Video - 1-2 min)**
| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | New to Cloze | "Your phone knows everyone you've ever called or texted. Cloze needs that information to remind you who to follow up with." |
| B | Has Cloze, not using | "You've been manually entering contacts when your phone already has them. Let's end that double-work right now." |
| C | Frustrated/overwhelmed | "This is the step most people skip because it sounds technical. It's not. Five minutes and your phone talks to Cloze forever." |

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**
- Syncs contacts (names, numbers, emails)
- Tracks call frequency (who you called, when, how long)
- Can sync text messages (optional - redacted by default)
- iPhone: Can sync via cable OR iCloud
- Android: Syncs via the Cloze app

**HOW (Video - 2-3 min)**
- Screen recording: iPhone iCloud sync method (preferred for Mac users)
- Screen recording: iPhone cable sync method (for Windows users)
- Note: "First sync via cable, then it syncs wirelessly when on same network"

**WHAT IF (Text)**
- Q: "What if I have a new phone?"
  - A: You'll need to re-sync. Cloze remembers your contacts, but needs to reconnect to the new device.
- Q: "What if I don't want my personal texts in Cloze?"
  - A: Text content is redacted by default. Cloze only sees THAT you texted someone, not WHAT you said.
- Q: "What if my contacts are a mess with duplicates?"
  - A: Good news - Cloze is smart about merging duplicates. Also check out contactsmith.com to clean your lists before or after import.

---

### 0C: Connect Your Calendar

**WHY (Video - 1-2 min)**
| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | New to Cloze | "Cloze can remind you about meetings and show them on your Agenda. But only if it knows your calendar exists." |
| B | Has Cloze, not using | "You're checking your calendar in one app, your contacts in another, your email in a third. Let's put it all in one place." |
| C | Frustrated/overwhelmed | "This is optional but makes your Agenda way more useful. Two clicks and done." |

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**
- Shows meetings on your Cloze Agenda
- Links meetings to contact records (see full history before a call)
- Works with Google Calendar, Outlook, iCloud

**HOW (Video - 1-2 min)**
- Screen recording: Settings → Connected Accounts → Add Calendar
- Brief, this one is straightforward

**WHAT IF (Text)**
- Q: "What if I have multiple calendars?"
  - A: Connect your primary business calendar first. You can add others later.
- Q: "Can Cloze create calendar events?"
  - A: Yes, but that's an Advanced feature. For now, just connect so it can read your calendar.

---

### 0D: Set Your View to Ninja Selling

**WHY (Video - 1-2 min)**
| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | New to Cloze | "Cloze works for all kinds of businesses, but you're using the Ninja Selling version. This one step makes sure you see the Contact Ladder segments and workflows designed specifically for real estate agents." |
| B | Has Cloze, not using | "If your Cloze doesn't show segments like Network, Fan, and Advocate, it's because you're not in the Ninja Selling view. Let's fix that in 30 seconds." |
| C | Frustrated/overwhelmed | "This is the easiest step in the whole setup - literally one click. But without it, nothing else will look like what I'm showing you." |

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**
- Cloze has different "views" optimized for different industries
- The Ninja Selling view includes:
  - Contact Ladder segments (SOI, Network, Fan, Advocate)
  - Real estate-specific stages (Warm, Hot, In Contract, Closed)
  - Templates and workflows designed for agents
  - Integration with real estate tools
- This is a one-time setup - you won't need to change it again

**HOW (Video - 1-2 min)**
- Screen recording: Settings → View → Select "Ninja Selling"
- Show how the interface changes when view is applied
- Confirm segments now show the Contact Ladder options

**WHAT IF (Text)**
- Q: "What if I don't see Ninja Selling as an option?"
  - A: Contact Cloze support - you may need to have this view enabled for your account.
- Q: "Can I switch back to a different view?"
  - A: Yes, but you'll lose access to Ninja Selling-specific features. Only change this if you're sure you don't want the Ninja Selling system.
- Q: "What if I'm already in Ninja Selling view?"
  - A: Great! You can skip this step. Verify by checking if you see Network, Fan, and Advocate in your segment options.

## MODULE 1: WHY CRM?

*Everyone sees this module, but the WHY version varies based on intake.*

### The Big Idea

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**
| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | New agent / new to CRM | "It doesn't matter who you have in your phone. It matters who has YOU in theirs. A CRM makes sure they never forget you exist." |
| B | Experienced, inconsistent | "You already know the business comes from your database. The problem isn't knowing - it's doing. A CRM is your accountability partner." |
| C | Burned by CRM before | "Every CRM sucks. I've used them all. The difference is whether it sucks AND helps you make money, or just sucks. Cloze helps." |

**Story to include (any version):**
> "I had an agent tell me his sister-in-law bought a house without him. Not because she didn't like him. Because she forgot he was in real estate. That's a $15,000 check that walked out the door because he wasn't staying in touch. A CRM is the tool that prevents that from ever happening to you."

**WHAT (Text + Interactive Calculator)**

**The Math:**
*[This section uses their personalized numbers from intake]*

"[Name], you said you want to make $[GCI Goal] this year. At an average sale price of $[ASP] and an average commission of [Commission %], that means you need [X] transactions.

Based on Ninja Selling research, about 2% of your database will transact with you each year IF you stay in consistent contact with them.

**Your Magic Number: [X ÷ 0.02] people**

That's how many people need to know, like, and trust you - and remember you're in real estate - to hit your goal."

**The Contacts Per Day Math:**
*[Show slider or input: 5/10/25 contacts per day]*

"If you complete [5] contacts per day, you'll have your [Magic Number] organized in [X] days.
If you complete [10] contacts per day, you'll have your [Magic Number] organized in [X] days.
If you complete [25] contacts per day, you'll have your [Magic Number] organized in [X] days."

**HOW (Text - No video needed for this module)**

"Here's the good news: you probably already HAVE [Magic Number] people who know you. They're in your phone, your email, your holiday card list. The problem isn't finding them - it's organizing them so you don't forget to stay in touch.

That's what the rest of this training is about. We're going to show you how to:
1. Tell Cloze WHO each person is (Segments)
2. Tell Cloze WHERE they are in their real estate journey (Stages)
3. Make sure you have their CONTACT INFO so you can actually reach them
4. Add the PERSONAL DETAILS that turn you from 'some agent' into 'my friend who sells real estate'

Then Cloze does the remembering for you. It tells you who to call today. All you have to do is make the call."

**WHAT IF (Text)**
- Q: "What if I don't have [Magic Number] people?"
  - A: You grow your database over time. Start with who you have. The 8x8 program (in Segments) is specifically designed to add new people to your sphere.
- Q: "What if I have way MORE than [Magic Number] people?"
  - A: Great problem to have. Focus on your best relationships first (Advocates and Fans). The rest get automated marketing.
- Q: "What if I hate making phone calls?"
  - A: Cloze isn't just about calls. Emails, texts, handwritten notes, coffee meetings - it all counts as staying in touch. The key is consistency, not the method.

---

## MODULE 2: THE CONTACT LADDER (Segments)

### Understanding Who's Who

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**
| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | New to concepts | "Not everyone in your phone is equal. Your mom isn't the same as a cold lead from Zillow. Segments help Cloze understand the difference." |
| B | Experienced, wants system | "You've got a gut feeling about who your best people are. Segments turn that gut feeling into a system that Cloze can act on." |
| C | Overwhelmed by contacts | "Right now you're looking at a list of 2,000 names and thinking 'where do I start?' Segments answer that question." |

**Story to include:**
> "Think about the last referral you got. I bet it came from one of maybe 20 people who actively send you business. Those are your Advocates - they jump on the bar and throw your card at strangers. Then there are people who will refer you IF someone asks - those are your Fans. Your job is to know who's who and treat them accordingly."

**WHAT (Text + Visual: The Segment Ladder graphic from PDF)**

**The Segment Ladder - Everyone Climbs Up:**

| Segment | Who They Are | What They Do | How Often to Touch |
|---------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Sphere of Influence (SOI)** | Everyone you meet | Starting point - you're figuring out the relationship | Every 45-60 days |
| **D - 8x8** | New people you're cultivating | Going through 8 touches in 8 weeks to establish yourself as their real estate person | Per the 8x8 program |
| **C - Network** | People who know/like/trust you | Will do business with YOU when ready, but won't actively refer | Automated marketing + occasional personal touch |
| **B - Fan** | People who like you AND will refer when asked | "Hey, I'm buying a house, who should I call?" "Call [You]!" | Monthly personal touch + marketing |
| **A - Advocate** | Your raving fans | Actively tell people about you without being asked | VIP treatment - personal touches, gifts, events |
| **Buyer / Seller** | Active clients | Currently in a transaction with you | Per their Stage (next module) |

**Key Insight:** 
> "I don't believe anyone can be a Fan or Advocate until they've done a transaction with you. They might LIKE you, but until they've experienced your service, they're Network at best. After the transaction, their annual review determines if they move up to Fan or Advocate."

**HOW (Video - 2-3 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*
1. Open a contact
2. Find the Segment dropdown (Relationship section)
3. Click to see all segment options
4. Select appropriate segment
5. Show how the contact now appears in filtered views

"Setting a segment takes three seconds. Click the contact, click the dropdown, pick who they are. That's it. Now Cloze knows how to remind you about this person."

**WHAT IF (Text + Short Video scenarios)**
- Q: "What if someone fits multiple categories?"
  - A: Pick the one that determines how often you want to touch them. An investor who's also an advocate? Probably Advocate, because that drives more touches.
- Q: "What if I'm not sure if they're a Fan or Network?"
  - A: Ask yourself: "Would they refer me if someone asked?" If yes but they wouldn't bring it up themselves → Fan. If you're not sure they'd refer you → Network.
- Q: "What about other agents?"
  - A: There's an Agent segment for that. Use it for agents you might refer to or receive referrals from.
- Q: "What about my vendors and partners?"
  - A: Vendor and Partner segments exist. Lenders, inspectors, title reps - anyone you work WITH rather than work FOR.

---

## MODULE 3: WHERE ARE THEY NOW? (Stages)

### Understanding the Journey

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**
| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | New to concepts | "Segments tell Cloze WHO someone is. Stages tell Cloze WHERE they are in buying or selling. A hot buyer needs a call every 3 days. A warm buyer needs one every 3 weeks. Stages make that automatic." |
| B | Experienced, wants system | "You've got a mental list of your hot prospects. Problem is, mental lists don't send reminders when you get busy with a closing. Stages do." |
| C | Overwhelmed by contacts | "You don't need to track everyone's journey. Only the people actually moving toward a transaction. That's what Stages are for." |

**Story to include:**
> "I had 50 people I was 'working with' at any given time. Half were hot, half were 'someday.' Without a system, I treated them all the same - which meant my hot buyers got the same attention as people who might buy in three years. Stages fixed that."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**Stages Are Only for Active Buyers and Sellers:**

| Stage | What It Means | How Often Cloze Reminds You |
|-------|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Warm** | Interested but not committed. Might buy/sell in 6-12 months. | Every 2-3 weeks |
| **Hot** | Ready to move in 90 days. Actively looking and committed to you. | Every 2-3 days |
| **In Contract** | Signed agreement, in escrow | Weekly (or per your transaction checklist) |
| **Closed** | Deal done! | Triggers move to appropriate Segment |
| **Lost** | Chose another agent, decided not to transact, or went cold | No reminders (archived from pipeline view) |

**Key Insight:**
> "Not everyone needs a Stage. Your Advocate who bought 5 years ago? They're in a Segment, not a Stage. Stages are for your PIPELINE - people actively moving toward a transaction."

**HOW (Video - 2-3 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*
1. Open a contact who's an active buyer/seller
2. Find the Stage buttons (Warm / Hot / In Contract / Closed / Lost)
3. Click to set stage
4. Show how the contact appears in the Pipeline view
5. Show how Keep in Touch reminders adjust based on Stage

"Changing a stage is even faster than segments - just click the button. Watch what happens to your Keep in Touch reminders when I move this person from Warm to Hot..."

**WHAT IF (Text)**
- Q: "What if someone goes from Hot back to Warm?"
  - A: Move them back. Life happens. Their loan fell through, they decided to wait. The stage reflects reality, not wishful thinking.
- Q: "What if someone's been Warm for a year?"
  - A: Time for a conversation. Either they're actually cold (move to Lost or back to their Segment only), or something's changed and they're ready to move to Hot.
- Q: "What about investors who buy multiple properties?"
  - A: Each PROPERTY they're interested in could be tracked in the Properties section. The person stays in whatever Stage reflects their current activity level.
- Q: "When does someone leave a Stage?"
  - A: When the transaction closes (or is lost). They go back to being managed by their Segment - now probably a Fan or Advocate since they've done business with you.

## MODULE 4: COMPLETE THE CONTACT

### The Three Things Every Contact Needs

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**
| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | New to CRM | "A contact without complete information is like a car without gas. It exists, but it won't get you anywhere. Cloze can't remind you to call someone if it doesn't have their phone number." |
| B | Experienced, messy data | "You've got 2,000 contacts and half of them are missing phone numbers, have wrong emails, or you don't even know who they are anymore. Let's fix that, ten at a time." |
| C | Overwhelmed | "You don't need to complete all 2,000 contacts. You need to complete [Magic Number]. That's [X] days at 10 per day. Totally doable." |

**Story to include:**
> "Outdated contact info doesn't just mean bad data - it means broken relationships. Every wrong number is a referral that goes to another agent. Every outdated email is repeat business walking away. Your database isn't a contact list - it's your business lifeline."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**The Three Things:**

1. **SEGMENT** - Who are they? (Module 2)
2. **STAGE** - Where are they in the journey? (Module 3 - only if applicable)
3. **CONTACT INFO** - How do you reach them?

**Contact Info Essentials:**
- Phone (mobile preferred)
- Email
- Mailing address (for postcards, closing gifts)

**Bonus - FORD (The Personal Details):**
- **F**amily - Spouse's name, kids, pets
- **O**ccupation - Where they work, what they do
- **R**ecreation - Hobbies, interests, how they spend free time
- **D**reams - Goals, aspirations, what they're working toward

**The "At a Glance" Field:**
> "I put the highlights in At a Glance: 'Drives Ford, married to Christine, works at United Electric, loves RVing, wants to retire to France.' When I call, I can see it instantly and actually have a human conversation."

**HOW (Video - 3-4 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*
1. Open a contact
2. Set Segment (quick review)
3. Set Stage if applicable (quick review)
4. Edit contact info:
   - How to add/edit phone numbers
   - How to set preferred phone
   - How to archive old numbers (not delete!)
   - How to add/edit emails
   - How to add mailing address
5. Edit "At a Glance" field for FORD info
6. Show where birthday/important dates go

**Key point to emphasize:** 
> "Archive, don't delete. If you delete an email, Cloze will find it again and re-add it. Archive tells Cloze 'I know about this, ignore it.'"

**The 10 Per Day Habit:**

"[Name], you need [Magic Number] complete contacts to hit your goal. At 10 per day, that's [X] days.

Here's how to find your 10:
1. Go to People
2. Click the Filter (funnel icon)
3. Sort by 'Contacts to Classify'

These are people Cloze knows about but YOU haven't organized yet. Do 10. Close Cloze. Come back tomorrow."

**HOW (Video - 2 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*
1. Navigate to People
2. Click Filter
3. Sort by "Contacts to Classify"
4. Quickly complete one contact (Segment, Stage, Contact Info)
5. Show the count decreasing

**WHAT IF (Text)**
- Q: "What if I don't have someone's phone number?"
  - A: Email them and ask. "Hey, I'm updating my contacts - what's the best number for you?" People appreciate being asked.
- Q: "What if I have multiple phone numbers for someone?"
  - A: Keep them all, but set one as "preferred." Archive any that are definitely dead.
- Q: "What if I don't know anything about them personally?"
  - A: That's what your next conversation is for. Use the At a Glance field to note what you want to LEARN, then update it after you talk.
- Q: "What if someone died?"
  - A: Archive the contact. If there was a spouse, update their record appropriately. (You may want to note the loss in their At a Glance in case you forget.)

---

## MODULE 5: TAG SMART

### Organize for Action

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**
| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | New to concepts | "Segments and Stages tell Cloze how to treat someone. Tags help YOU find people when you need them. Different purposes, both important." |
| B | Experienced, wants system | "You've got a listing in Henderson and want to email everyone interested in Henderson. Tags make that a 30-second task." |
| C | Over-tagger / overwhelmed | "I've seen agents with 200 tags and no idea what half of them mean. Let's talk about when to tag and when not to." |

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**The Tag Test - Ask Two Questions:**

1. Will I MARKET to this tag?
2. Will I SEARCH for this tag?

If yes to either → Tag it.
If no to both → Don't.

**Net Tags vs Spear Tags:**

| Type | Purpose | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Net Tags** | Broad categories for marketing | #investor, #firsttimebuyer, #downsizer, #relocation |
| **Spear Tags** | Specific action triggers | #henderson, #summerlin, #luxury, #fixandflip |

**How I Use Spear Tags:**
> "When I had a new listing in Lake Las Vegas, I'd search #lakelasvegas and find every buyer who'd mentioned interest. Send them all a quick email: 'New listing just hit that I think you'll love. Saturday or Sunday work for a showing?' That's a spear - targeted, specific, action-oriented."

**How I Use Net Tags:**
> "I tagged all my referring agents with #referral and their state - #referral #california. When someone said 'I'm moving to San Diego,' I searched #referral #california and found agents I'd met at conferences. Net tags cast wide, spear tags strike specific."

**HOW (Video - 2-3 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*
1. Open a contact
2. Find the tag field (below name, shows as hashtags)
3. Click "Add tag"
4. Type tag name (no spaces - use lowercase)
5. Show autocomplete for existing tags
6. Add multiple tags to one contact
7. Search for a tag to find everyone with it
8. Show how to bulk-email a tagged group (brief preview - detailed in Advanced)

**WHAT IF (Text)**
- Q: "What's the difference between Tags and Segments?"
  - A: Segments control how often Cloze reminds you to touch someone. Tags are just labels for finding people. A contact can only have ONE segment but MANY tags.
- Q: "Can I tag someone with a community they already bought in?"
  - A: Sure, if you want to send them market updates. But ask yourself the two questions first - will you actually use that tag?
- Q: "What if I misspell a tag?"
  - A: You'll end up with two tags. #summerlin and #sumerlin won't merge. Be consistent. Check autocomplete before creating new tags.
- Q: "How many tags is too many?"
  - A: If you can't remember what a tag is for, you have too many. Audit your tags periodically and delete unused ones.

---

## MODULE 6: THE DAILY RITUAL

### Making Cloze Work For You

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**
| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | New to CRM | "Cloze is only useful if you use it. The agents who get results check their Agenda twice a day and do what it tells them. That's it." |
| B | Experienced, inconsistent | "You've had a CRM before. It worked when you used it, collected dust when you didn't. Let's build a habit that sticks." |
| C | Overwhelmed | "You don't need to master every feature. You need to check your Agenda in the morning, check it in the afternoon, and do what it says. Everything else is extra." |

**Story to include:**
> "The Agenda looks at EVERYTHING - your emails, your calendar, your contact history - and narrows it down to what you need to know RIGHT NOW. It's like having an assistant who says 'Here are the 5 things you need to do today.' Your job is just to show up and listen."

**WHAT (Text + Visual: Agenda screenshot)**

**The Agenda Shows You:**

| Section | What It Is | What To Do |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Goals** | Your outreach/reaction targets | Glance at it. Are you on pace? |
| **Alerts** | Leads, DocuSign notifications | Act on these immediately |
| **Unread Mail** | Important emails Cloze flagged | Review and respond |
| **Meetings** | Today's calendar | Prep by clicking to see contact history |
| **Keep in Touch** | People you haven't talked to in a while | GOLD. These are your calls/texts for the day. |
| **Important Dates** | Birthdays, anniversaries | Send a quick personal note |
| **To Do / Next Steps** | Tasks you've set | Work through them |

**The Keep in Touch Magic:**
> "Keep in Touch is the whole reason Cloze exists. It says 'You haven't talked to Sarah in 3 weeks. You should reach out.' You swipe, it writes an email, you tweak it and send. Sarah thinks you're thoughtful. You didn't have to remember anything."

**The Two-Check Habit:**

**Morning (with coffee):**
- Check Alerts (any hot leads?)
- Check Meetings (who am I seeing today? Review their history)
- Check Keep in Touch (who should I reach out to?)

**Afternoon (before you finish for the day):**
- Check Keep in Touch again (anyone you missed?)
- Check Important Dates (any birthdays tomorrow to prep for?)
- Do your 10 contact completions (if you haven't yet)

**HOW (Video - 3-4 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*
1. Open Cloze → lands on Agenda
2. Walk through each section briefly
3. Show a Keep in Touch reminder
4. Swipe to email (show the auto-generated email)
5. Send or customize
6. Show how that contact disappears from Keep in Touch (clock reset)

**Also show on phone:**
*Brief screen recording showing:*
1. Open Cloze app
2. Same Agenda view
3. Quick swipe-to-email on mobile
4. "Looks exactly the same on phone - do this while you're waiting in line"

**WHAT IF (Text)**
- Q: "What if my Agenda is overwhelming with too many items?"
  - A: That means you have too many people marked as active relationships without actually staying in touch. Either do the outreach or adjust their Segment so Cloze stops reminding you.
- Q: "What if Keep in Touch suggests someone I don't want to talk to?"
  - A: Archive them or change their Segment to something with less frequent touch requirements.
- Q: "What if I don't have time for all my Keep in Touches?"
  - A: Do what you can. A quick text counts. A quick email counts. Cloze isn't judging quality, just connection.
- Q: "What if I reached out outside of Cloze?"
  - A: If it was via email or text that Cloze tracks, it already knows. If it was a phone call, you can log it manually (or it auto-logs if phone is synced).

## MODULE 7: YOUR GOALS (Optional)

*This module is shown but marked optional. Some agents love gamification, others find it stressful.*

### Tracking Your Activity

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**
| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Motivated by numbers | "You can set your GCI goal in Cloze and it will tell you exactly how many outreaches you need per week to hit it. It's like having a scoreboard for your business." |
| B | Skeptical of gamification | "This feature is optional. But if you've ever wondered 'am I doing enough?' this answers it with math instead of anxiety." |

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**Cloze analyzed 10,000 real estate agents and found the patterns:**
- X outreaches per week → Y reactions → Z closings

**Your personalized targets:**
*[Pull from intake data]*

"Based on your $[GCI Goal] target at $[ASP] average price, Cloze recommends:
- [X] outreaches per week
- [Y] reactions per week
- [Z] sides per year"

**HOW (Video - 2-3 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*
1. Click the gear icon on Goals section
2. Show GCI field → enter amount
3. Show Average Sale Price → enter amount
4. Show how other numbers auto-calculate
5. Show the ring visualization filling up as you hit targets

**WHAT IF (Text)**
- Q: "What counts as an outreach?"
  - A: Any email, call, or text you initiate to a contact. Cloze tracks these automatically if your accounts are connected.
- Q: "What counts as a reaction?"
  - A: When they respond - reply to your email, text you back, answer your call.
- Q: "What if the suggested numbers seem impossible?"
  - A: Either adjust your GCI goal or look at whether you're spending time on the right activities. The math is the math.
- Q: "Can I turn this off?"
  - A: Yes. You can minimize the Goals section. Some agents find it motivating, others don't. Use what works for you.

## NOTES FOR DEVELOPMENT

1. **Calculator/Personalization Engine Needed:**
   - Input: GCI Goal, Average Sale Price, Commission %
   - Output: Transactions needed, Magic Number (contacts), Days to complete at various rates
   - This data should persist and appear throughout modules

2. **Conditional Logic Needed:**
   - Intake determines which WHY video version plays
   - Intake determines if Module 0 appears first
   - Module 7 should be clearly marked as optional

3. **Integration with Cloze:**
   - Could we detect via API if their email/phone is connected? Would save Module 0 for those who need it.
   - Future: Could pull actual contact count from their Cloze for more accurate projections

4. **contactsmith.com Mention:**
   - Referenced in Module 0B (phone sync) for list cleaning
   - Should this have its own mini-module or just remain a reference?

5. **ninjacalc.app:**
   - Functionality to be built into Module 1 directly
   - May want standalone calculator widget elsewhere on site too
