# DEEP DIVE 7: CUSTOMIZING SEGMENTS & AUDIENCES

## howtoCloze.com / contactladder.com

---

## OVERVIEW

**Goal:** Master the art of organizing contacts through custom segments and audiences to make Cloze work exactly how you need it.

**Who This Is For:** Agents who have completed Essentials and want to go beyond the default Contact Ladder to create their own organizational systems.

**The Promise:**

> "The Ninja Selling view gives you Network, Fan, and Advocate segments out of the box. But what if you work with investors differently than first-time buyers? What if you have a unique niche that doesn't fit the standard boxes? This Deep Dive shows you how to customize Cloze to match YOUR business. Not force your business to match Cloze."

**Prerequisites:**
- Completed Cloze Essentials (Modules 1-6)
- Ninja Selling view enabled in Cloze
- Understanding of default Segments and Tags

---

## MODULE 1: SEGMENTS VS AUDIENCES - KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

### Understanding Your Organizational Tools

**WHY (Video - 3-4 min)**

**Hook:** "Most agents are using Segments when they should be using Audiences, and vice versa. Once you understand the difference, organizing your database becomes 10x easier."

**The Problem:**

You have 2,000 contacts and need to answer questions like:
- "Who are my active luxury buyers?"
- "Which past clients haven't heard from me in 6 months?"
- "Who's interested in Henderson AND is a first-time buyer?"

Segments alone can't answer these questions. You need Audiences.

**Story:**

> "I spent two years using segments for everything. Couldn't find 'investors interested in multi-family.' Kept creating more segments. Total mess. Then I learned: Segments equal WHO someone is. Audiences equal WHAT you're looking for. Once I got that distinction, everything clicked!"

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

### The Core Distinction

| Feature | Segments | Audiences |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Purpose** | Define WHO someone is to you | Find GROUPS based on criteria |
| **Assignment** | Manual - you choose one segment per contact | Automatic - contacts appear based on filters |
| **Count** | One per contact | A contact can be in many audiences |
| **Affects** | Keep in Touch frequency, reminders | Search results, bulk actions |
| **Examples** | Network, Fan, Advocate, Buyer, Seller | "Henderson Buyers," "Warm Investors," "Clients who closed in 2024" |
| **Created** | Pre-set by Ninja Selling view (but customizable) | You create these as needed |

### When to Use Each

**Use SEGMENTS when:**
- Defining relationship level (Contact Ladder: SOI → Network → Fan → Advocate)
- Determining touch frequency (how often Cloze reminds you)
- Categorizing role (Buyer, Seller, Vendor, Partner, Agent)
- Setting long-term classification

**Use AUDIENCES when:**
- Searching for specific groups ("All buyers in my pipeline")
- Preparing for bulk actions (mail merge, campaign enrollment)
- Analyzing your database ("How many Advocates do I have?")
- Finding contacts that meet multiple criteria ("Fans + #investor + haven't touched in 60 days")

**Key Insight:**

> "Segments are PERMANENT labels. Audiences are DYNAMIC queries. A contact's Segment might be 'Fan' forever. But they might be in the 'Hot Buyers' audience this month. Then disappear after they close. Then appear in 'Past Clients for Annual Review' audience next year. Segments define them. Audiences find them. Why this matters: You've got 2,000 contacts. Find exactly who you need in 5 seconds instead of scrolling for 20 minutes."

**HOW (Video - 4-5 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*
1. Open a contact → Show the Segment field (single selection)
2. Navigate to People → Click Audiences dropdown
3. Show how one contact appears in multiple audiences
4. Create a simple audience: "All Fans"
5. Show how contacts automatically populate
6. Change a contact's Segment → Show them disappear/appear in the audience

**Demonstrate the difference:**
- Change contact from Network → Fan
- Watch them appear in "All Fans" audience automatically
- Show they're still tagged with whatever tags they have
- Explain: "Segment changed. Tags didn't. Audiences update automatically based on criteria."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

**Q: "Can I have custom segments beyond the Contact Ladder?"**
- A: Yes! You can create segments like "Referral Agent," "Investor," "Team Member" - anything that represents a PERMANENT relationship classification.

**Q: "What's better - a Tag or an Audience?"**
- A: Tags are simpler for basic filtering (#investor). Audiences are more powerful for complex criteria ("Investors + Warm Stage + Last contact >30 days ago"). If you find yourself creating super-specific tags, you probably need an Audience instead.

**Q: "Can I search for contacts NOT in a segment?"**
- A: Yes, in Audiences. Example: Create "Not Yet Segmented" audience = anyone without a segment assigned. Perfect for finding contacts to classify.

**Q: "If Segments control Keep in Touch frequency, why would I ever change them?"**
- A: When the relationship changes. A buyer who closes becomes a Past Client. Their Stage changes from "Hot" to (none), and their Segment might move to Fan or Advocate depending on their experience. The transaction changed who they are to you.

## MODULE 2: CUSTOMIZING YOUR SEGMENTS

### Tailoring the Contact Ladder to Your Business

**WHY (Video - 3-4 min)**

**Hook:** "The default Ninja Selling segments work for 90% of agents. But if you have a niche - luxury, investors, relocations - you need segments that reflect how YOU actually work."

**The Case for Custom Segments:**

The Ninja Selling view includes:
- Sphere of Influence (SOI)
- Network
- Fan
- Advocate
- Buyer / Seller
- Past Client

But what if you:
- Work mostly with investors who need different treatment than homeowners?
- Have a team and need to segment by team member?
- Focus on luxury where "Fan" and "Advocate" mean something different at the $2M+ price point?
- Get most business from referral partners, not individuals?

**Story:**

> "My 'Advocate' investor sends me 10 deals per year. My 'Advocate' luxury seller refers once every 3 years. Same label. Totally different impact. I created separate segments: 'Investor - Active' and 'Investor - VIP' with different Keep in Touch frequencies. Game changer. Now my reminders match reality!"

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

### Segment Customization Options

**You Can Customize:**

| What | How | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| **Segment Names** | Rename existing segments | Match your language ("Raving Fan" instead of "Advocate") |
| **Keep in Touch Frequency** | Adjust days between reminders | VIPs need more frequent contact |
| **New Segments** | Create entirely new categories | "Vendor," "Lender Partner," "Team Member," "Investor - Active" |
| **Segment Colors** | Change visual coding | Quick recognition in contact lists |
| **Default Segment** | Set what new contacts start as | Auto-assign "SOI" to anyone not yet classified |

### Best Practices for Custom Segments

**1. Don't Over-Segment**

❌ Bad: 15 segments for every possible type of client
- Investor - Single Family
- Investor - Multi-Family
- Investor - Fix and Flip
- Investor - Buy and Hold
- Investor - Out of State
- (This should be ONE segment + Tags)

✅ Good: Use segments for RELATIONSHIP level, Tags for DETAILS
- Segment: "Investor - Active"
- Tags: #singlefamily #fixandflip #outofstate

**2. Segments Should Drive Action**

Every segment should have a clear answer to: "How often do I need to touch people in this segment?"

If the answer is "it depends," that's not a segment - it's a Tag or Audience.

**3. Preserve the Contact Ladder Logic**

The ladder (SOI → Network → Fan → Advocate) works because it's hierarchical. If you add custom segments, maintain the logic:
- Who refers actively? (Top tier)
- Who refers when asked? (Mid tier)
- Who might transact but won't refer? (Lower tier)
- Who are you still building relationship with? (Entry tier)

**HOW (Video - 5-6 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

**Part 1: Renaming a Segment**
1. Go to Settings → Customizations → Segments
2. Click on "Advocate"
3. Rename to "Raving Fan"
4. Save
5. Show how it appears renamed throughout Cloze

**Part 2: Adjusting Keep in Touch Frequency**
1. Still in Segment settings
2. Find "Keep in Touch" field
3. Change from default (30 days) to custom (14 days for VIPs)
4. Save
5. Open a contact in that segment → Show Keep in Touch updated

**Part 3: Creating a New Segment**
1. Click "Add Segment"
2. Name: "Investor - VIP"
3. Set Keep in Touch: 21 days
4. Choose color: Purple
5. Save
6. Open a contact → Assign to new segment
7. Show how Keep in Touch immediately reflects new frequency

**Part 4: Setting Default Segment**
1. Settings → Customizations → Segments
2. Find "Default Segment for New Contacts"
3. Set to "SOI"
4. Show how new contact auto-assigns

**WHAT IF (Text)**

**Q: "If I rename 'Advocate' to 'Raving Fan,' will it break anything?"**
- A: No. It's just a label. All functionality stays the same. Your contacts stay assigned, Keep in Touch reminders continue, nothing breaks.

**Q: "Can I delete a segment?"**
- A: Yes, but Cloze will ask you what to do with contacts currently in that segment. You'll need to reassign them first or move them to a different segment.

**Q: "What if I have too many custom segments and want to simplify?"**
- A: Merge segments by reassigning contacts, then delete the unused segment. Example: Move all "Investor - Active" to "Advocate," move "Investor - Warm" to "Network," then delete the custom investor segments.

**Q: "Should I create a segment for 'Unassigned' or 'To Be Classified'?"**
- A: No! Use an Audience instead. Create an audience with criteria: "Segment = (none)" - this dynamically shows anyone not yet classified without creating a permanent segment label.

**Q: "Can different team members have different segment names?"**
- A: No. Segments are account-wide. If you're on a team plan, all members see the same segment list. This is good - it keeps everyone organized the same way.

## MODULE 3: CREATING POWERFUL AUDIENCES

### Your Dynamic Contact Finder

**WHY (Video - 3-4 min)**

**Hook:** "Audiences are the most powerful feature in Cloze that most agents never use. Once you master them, you'll wonder how you ever worked without them."

**The Audience Power:**

Imagine you need to:
- Email all buyers who haven't been contacted in 30 days
- Find everyone interested in a specific community
- Pull a list of past clients for annual reviews
- Identify contacts with incomplete information

You could spend 20 minutes manually filtering through contacts. Or you create an Audience once, and it updates automatically forever.

**Story:**

> "I created a 'Buyers - Going Cold' audience. Stage equals Warm. Last contact over 45 days. Check it every Monday morning. Anyone there? Reach out immediately. Early warning system on autopilot. Never lose buyers to neglect. Updates automatically. That audience saves me 5-10 deals per year!"

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

### What Audiences Can Filter By

**Available Criteria:**

| Category | Examples | Use Case |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Segments** | Network, Fan, Advocate, Buyer, Seller | "All Advocates for VIP event" |
| **Stages** | Warm, Hot, In Contract, Closed, Lost | "All Hot buyers for urgent new listing" |
| **Tags** | #investor, #luxury, #henderson, #firsttimebuyer | "Everyone interested in Summerlin" |
| **Contact Info** | Has email, Has mobile, Missing address | "Find incomplete contact records" |
| **Activity** | Last contact date, Last email opened, No activity in X days | "Re-engagement needed" |
| **Properties** | Buyer criteria, Seller criteria, Property matches | "Buyers with <$500K budget" (requires Properties) |
| **Next Steps** | Has open task, Overdue Next Step | "Follow up needed" |
| **Custom Fields** | Any custom field you've created | "Anniversary date this month" |
| **Combination** | Multiple criteria with AND/OR logic | "Fans + #investor + last contact >60 days" |

### Audience Types: Simple vs. Advanced

**Simple Audiences (Single Criteria):**
- All Fans
- All Buyers
- Everyone tagged #investor
- Contacts missing email addresses

**Advanced Audiences (Multiple Criteria):**
- Fans + Last contact >90 days (Advocates who need attention)
- Warm Buyer + #luxury + #henderson (Targeted listing alert list)
- Network + No activity in 6 months + Has email (Re-engagement campaign)
- Past Client + Closed 3 years ago (Annual review outreach)

**HOW (Video - 6-7 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

**Part 1: Create a Simple Audience**
1. Go to People
2. Click "Audiences" dropdown → "Create Audience"
3. Name: "All Investors"
4. Add filter: Tags → Contains → #investor
5. Save
6. Show results: All contacts tagged #investor appear
7. Click into audience → Show contact list

**Part 2: Create an Advanced Audience (Multiple Criteria)**
1. Create Audience → Name: "Buyers - Going Cold"
2. Add filter: Stage = Warm
3. Add filter: Last Contact > 45 days ago
4. Show results preview
5. Save
6. Explain: "This updates automatically. Check it weekly."

**Part 3: Create a "Missing Info" Audience**
1. Create Audience → Name: "Incomplete Contacts"
2. Add filter: Missing mobile phone
3. Add filter: OR Missing email
4. Show contacts that need completion
5. Explain: "Perfect for finding your next 10 contacts to complete"

**Part 4: Audience Actions**
1. Open an Audience ("All Investors")
2. Show bulk actions: Mail merge, Add tag, Change segment
3. Demonstrate: Select all → Add tag #q1campaign
4. Show: Everyone in audience now has the tag

**Part 5: Edit/Delete an Audience**
1. Open Audiences dropdown
2. Find "Edit" icon next to saved audience
3. Modify criteria: Change "Last contact >45 days" to ">30 days"
4. Save → Show updated results
5. Show delete option (with warning)

**WHAT IF (Text)**

**Q: "How many audiences can I create?"**
- A: Unlimited. Create as many as you need. Common setup: 10-20 audiences for different marketing purposes.

**Q: "Can I share audiences with my team?"**
- A: Yes! When creating an audience, there's an option to make it "Shared." Team members can then use the same audience.

**Q: "Do contacts know they're in an audience?"**
- A: No. Audiences are invisible to contacts. They're just for YOUR organization.

**Q: "Can I export an audience to a CSV?"**
- A: Yes. Open the audience → Click "Export" → Download CSV with all contact info.

**Q: "What's the difference between an Audience and a Tag?"**
- A: Tags are manual labels you add. Audiences are automatic filters based on criteria. Tags are simpler. Audiences are more powerful for complex combinations.

**Q: "If I delete an audience, do I delete the contacts?"**
- A: No! Deleting an audience just removes the filter/query. All contacts remain in Cloze untouched.

## MODULE 4: AUDIENCE STRATEGIES FOR REAL ESTATE AGENTS

### Pre-Built Audiences You Should Create Today

**WHY (Video - 3-4 min)**

**Hook:** "Don't start from scratch. These 10 audiences solve 90% of your daily needs. Set them up once, use them forever."

**The Strategy:**

Most agents create audiences on the fly when they need them, then forget what they created. Better approach: Build your core audience library now based on recurring needs.

**Story to include:**

> "I used to think 'I'll create audiences as I need them.' Problem was, I'd create 'Hot Buyers' three different times with slightly different criteria. Then wonder why my numbers didn't match. Total chaos. Now I have a standard set of 12 audiences I use weekly. Same filters. Same criteria. Repeatable process. My numbers actually make sense!"

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

### The Essential Audience Library for Real Estate Agents

**PIPELINE MANAGEMENT AUDIENCES:**

| Audience Name | Criteria | Use Case |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| **All Active Buyers** | Stage = Warm OR Stage = Hot | See your full buyer pipeline at a glance |
| **All Active Sellers** | Stage = Warm OR Stage = Hot (Seller) | See your full seller pipeline |
| **Buyers - Going Cold** | Stage = Warm + Last contact >30 days | Weekly check-in to prevent lost buyers |
| **Sellers - Going Cold** | Stage = Warm (Seller) + Last contact >30 days | Weekly check-in to prevent lost listings |
| **Hot & Urgent** | Stage = Hot + Last contact >7 days | Daily priority list |
| **In Contract - Closing Soon** | Stage = In Contract + Estimated close <30 days | Transaction checklist focus |

**RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT AUDIENCES:**

| Audience Name | Criteria | Use Case |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| **Advocates Need Love** | Segment = Advocate + Last contact >60 days | Monthly VIP check-in |
| **Fans Need Love** | Segment = Fan + Last contact >90 days | Quarterly personal touch |
| **SOI to Organize** | Segment = SOI + Added >14 days ago | Find contacts stuck in SOI too long |
| **Past Clients - Annual Review** | Segment = Past Client + Closed 12 months ago | Trigger annual reviews |

**DATA QUALITY AUDIENCES:**

| Audience Name | Criteria | Use Case |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| **Incomplete Contacts** | Missing mobile OR Missing email | Your "10 per day" completion list |
| **No Segment Assigned** | Segment = (none) | Classify these into Contact Ladder |
| **No Activity in 6 Months** | Last contact >180 days + Segment = Network/Fan/Advocate | Re-engagement or archive decision |

**MARKETING AUDIENCES:**

| Audience Name | Criteria | Use Case |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| **Investors - Active** | Tag = #investor + (Stage = Warm OR Segment = Fan/Advocate) | Investment property alerts |
| **Luxury Buyers** | Tag = #luxury + Stage = Warm/Hot | High-end listing announcements |
| **First-Time Buyers** | Tag = #firsttimebuyer + Stage = Warm/Hot | Educational content campaigns |
| **Downsizers** | Tag = #downsizer + Segment = Network/Fan/Advocate | 55+ community announcements |

**HOW (Video - 8-10 min)**

*Screen recording showing creation of 3-4 key audiences with detailed explanations:*

**Example 1: "Buyers - Going Cold"**
1. Navigate to Create Audience
2. Name: "Buyers - Going Cold"
3. Add criteria:
   - Stage = Warm
   - Last Contact > 30 days ago
4. Preview results (should show 10-20 people typically)
5. Save
6. Explain workflow: "Check this every Monday. If anyone's here, reach out."

**Example 2: "Advocates Need Love"**
1. Create Audience
2. Name: "Advocates Need Love"
3. Add criteria:
   - Segment = Advocate
   - Last Contact > 60 days ago
4. Preview results
5. Save
6. Explain: "These are your VIPs. If they're here, drop everything and reach out."

**Example 3: "Incomplete Contacts"**
1. Create Audience
2. Name: "Incomplete Contacts"
3. Add criteria:
   - Missing mobile phone (OR)
   - Missing email (OR)
   - Segment = (none)
4. Preview results (might show 100-500 contacts)
5. Save
6. Explain: "This is your 10-per-day list. Complete 10 from this audience daily."

**Example 4: "Past Clients - Annual Review"**
(Requires custom date field or manual filtering)
1. Create Audience
2. Name: "Annual Reviews Due"
3. Add criteria:
   - Segment = Past Client
   - Closed Date = 12 months ago (±30 days)
4. Note: May need to use "Last Stage Change" as proxy
5. Save
6. Explain: "Check monthly. Anyone here gets annual review call."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

**Q: "Do I really need all these audiences?"**
- A: Start with 5-6 that match your immediate needs. Add more as you identify patterns. Common starting set: All Active Buyers, Buyers Going Cold, Advocates Need Love, Incomplete Contacts.

**Q: "Can I create audiences for specific neighborhoods?"**
- A: Yes! Tag contacts with location tags (#henderson, #summerlin), then create audiences by tag. Example: "Summerlin Buyers" = Tag #summerlin + Stage Warm/Hot.

**Q: "What if my 'Going Cold' audience shows 50 people?"**
- A: That's your backlog. Either tighten the criteria (>45 days instead of >30), or accept that you have 50 people who need outreach. Batch them: 10 per day for a week.

**Q: "Should I create separate audiences for each campaign?"**
- A: Depends. If it's a one-time campaign, just filter on the fly. If it's recurring (monthly investor updates), create a permanent audience.

---

## MODULE 5: ADVANCED FILTERING & BOOLEAN LOGIC

### Combining Criteria Like a Pro

**WHY (Video - 3-4 min)**

**Hook:** "Simple audiences are powerful. Advanced audiences are game-changing. Once you understand AND/OR logic, you can find EXACTLY who you need in seconds."

**The Power of Precision:**

Simple audience: "All buyers"
- Might return 200 people
- Too broad for targeted outreach

Advanced audience: "Hot buyers + Budget $400-600K + Interested in Henderson + Last contact <14 days"
- Returns 8 people
- Perfect for "I just listed in Henderson at $550K" email

**Story to include:**

> "I had a $1.2M listing coming in Summerlin. Created an audience: Tag luxury OR Tag summerlin. AND Segment equals Fan OR Advocate OR Buyer. AND Last contact under 90 days. Found 23 warm contacts to personally reach out to. Got 4 showings booked before the listing even hit MLS. That's the power of advanced filtering!"

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

### Understanding AND vs OR Logic

**AND Logic (Must match ALL criteria):**

Example: Fan + #investor + Last contact >60 days
- Must be a Fan
- AND must be tagged #investor
- AND must not have been contacted in 60+ days

Result: Very specific, smaller list

**OR Logic (Must match ANY criteria):**

Example: Stage = Warm OR Stage = Hot
- Can be Warm
- OR can be Hot
- OR can be both

Result: Broader, larger list

**Combining AND + OR (The Power Move):**

Example: (Segment = Fan OR Segment = Advocate) AND (Tag = #luxury) AND (Last contact <90 days)

Translation: "Anyone who's a Fan or Advocate, who's interested in luxury, and who I've talked to recently"

### Real-World Advanced Audience Examples

**Example 1: "VIP Listing Alert List"**
- (Segment = Fan OR Advocate)
- AND (Tag = #luxury OR Tag = #summerlin OR Tag = #henderson)
- AND Last contact <120 days
- AND Has email

**Purpose:** Who to email first when you get a good listing

**Example 2: "Re-Engagement Campaign"**
- (Segment = Network OR Fan)
- AND Last contact >180 days
- AND Has mobile phone
- AND NOT Stage = Lost

**Purpose:** People who've gone cold but are worth reviving

**Example 3: "New Listing - Investor Alert"**
- Tag = #investor
- AND (Segment = Advocate OR Fan OR Stage = Warm OR Stage = Hot)
- AND (Tag = #fixandflip OR Tag = #rental)
- AND Budget max >$300K (if using Properties feature)

**Purpose:** Investors who might want to see a new investment property

**Example 4: "Annual Client Review"**
- Segment = Past Client
- AND Last contact >90 days
- AND Closed date >6 months ago
- AND NOT currently in Stage (no active transaction)

**Purpose:** Past clients who need a check-in

**HOW (Video - 6-7 min)**

*Screen recording showing complex audience creation:*

**Example: Create "VIP New Listing Alert"**
1. Navigate to Create Audience
2. Name: "VIP New Listing Alert"
3. Start with OR group:
   - Click "Add OR Group"
   - Add: Segment = Fan
   - Add: Segment = Advocate
4. Add AND criteria:
   - Tag contains #luxury (OR)
   - Tag contains #summerlin (OR)
   - Tag contains #henderson
5. Add AND criteria:
   - Last contact < 120 days
6. Add AND criteria:
   - Has email = Yes
7. Preview results
8. Save
9. Show how to use: "When I get a listing in Summerlin, I open this audience and mail merge them all."

**Demonstrate the logic:**
- Show contact that matches (Fan + #summerlin + contacted 30 days ago + has email) → Appears
- Show contact that doesn't match (Network + #summerlin) → Doesn't appear
- Show contact that doesn't match (Fan + #summerlin + no email) → Doesn't appear
- Explain: "ALL criteria must be true for AND. ANY criteria can be true for OR."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

**Q: "This seems complicated. Do I really need advanced filtering?"**
- A: Start simple. Master single-criteria audiences first. Add complexity when you need it. Most agents use 3-4 simple audiences 90% of the time and 1-2 advanced audiences for special situations.

**Q: "Can I save an advanced audience for later reuse?"**
- A: Yes! That's the whole point. Create "VIP Listing Alert" once with complex criteria, then just open it whenever you need that specific group.

**Q: "What if I create an advanced audience and get zero results?"**
- A: Your criteria are too restrictive. Remove one criterion at a time until you see results, then decide if you need to adjust your logic.

**Q: "Can I nest multiple OR groups within AND logic?"**
- A: Yes, but it gets complex fast. If you find yourself building super-complicated logic, consider whether you're overcomplicating it. Sometimes two simpler audiences work better than one complex one.

**Q: "Can I use audiences to bulk-edit contacts?"**
- A: Yes! Open an audience → Select all → Bulk actions: Add tag, Change segment, Add to campaign, etc. This is incredibly powerful.

## MODULE 6: MAINTAINING YOUR SYSTEM

### Keeping Segments and Audiences Effective Long-Term

**WHY (Video - 3-4 min)**

**Hook:** "You'll create the perfect organizational system. Then six months later it'll be a mess. Here's how to keep it clean and useful forever."

**The Maintenance Reality:**

Your database is alive. People move through segments. Audiences get stale. Tags multiply. Without regular maintenance:
- Audiences return outdated contacts
- Segments become meaningless
- You lose trust in the system and stop using it

**Story to include:**

> "I had an audience called 'Hot Buyers.' After six months, I realized half the people in it had closed deals. They weren't buyers anymore. I just hadn't updated their Stages. The audience was useless. Now I have a monthly maintenance routine. Check Stages. Clean audiences. Audit segments. Takes 30 minutes per month. Keeps everything accurate. Why this matters: Bad data leads to bad decisions."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

### The Monthly Maintenance Checklist

**WEEK 1: Segment Audit**

| Task | What to Check | Action |
|------|--------------|--------|
| **SOI Review** | Anyone in SOI >60 days? | Move to Network or Archive |
| **Warm/Hot Stage** | Anyone in Warm >6 months? | Move to Lost or remove Stage |
| **In Contract** | Closed transactions not updated? | Move to Past Client, assign Fan/Advocate |
| **Lost Stage** | Anyone you've re-engaged? | Update to Warm or remove Lost |

**WEEK 2: Audience Cleanup**

| Task | What to Check | Action |
|------|--------------|--------|
| **Unused Audiences** | Any audiences you haven't opened in 90 days? | Delete or archive |
| **Duplicate Audiences** | Multiple audiences with similar criteria? | Merge into one standardized version |
| **Stale Criteria** | "Last contact >30 days" audiences returning hundreds? | Tighten criteria or create graduated versions |

**WEEK 3: Tag Hygiene**

| Task | What to Check | Action |
|------|--------------|--------|
| **Misspelled Tags** | #summerlin and #sumerlin both exist? | Merge, standardize spelling |
| **Unused Tags** | Tags with <3 contacts? | Delete unless strategic |
| **Redundant Tags** | #firsttimebuyer and #fthb both exist? | Pick one, re-tag contacts, delete other |
| **Tag Audit** | Run tag report | Keep tags under 50 total |

**WEEK 4: Data Quality**

| Task | What to Check | Action |
|------|--------------|--------|
| **"Incomplete Contacts" Audience** | How many contacts missing info? | Complete 10 per day until <50 remain |
| **Dead Emails** | Bounced emails not archived? | Archive bounced addresses |
| **Duplicate Contacts** | Merge suggestions from Cloze? | Review and merge |
| **Archive Inactive** | Anyone with no activity in 2+ years? | Archive or mark for deletion |

### Quarterly Deep Clean

**Every 3 Months:**

1. **Segment Distribution Analysis**
   - How many contacts in each segment?
   - Does distribution make sense? (Should have MORE Network than Advocates)
   - Are segments being used or is everyone piling into one?

2. **Audience Performance Review**
   - Which audiences are you actually using?
   - Which return useful vs overwhelming results?
   - Delete or refine accordingly

3. **Tag Strategy Review**
   - Are tags serving their purpose?
   - Are you tagging consistently?
   - Can any tags be retired?

4. **Keep in Touch Frequency Check**
   - Are reminders overwhelming or manageable?
   - Adjust segment frequencies if needed

**HOW (Video - 5-6 min)**

*Screen recording showing maintenance workflows:*

**Part 1: Segment Audit**
1. Go to People → Filter by Segment = SOI
2. Sort by "Added Date"
3. Find contacts older than 60 days
4. Open contact → Review history
5. Decide: Move to Network or Archive
6. Bulk select → Change segment for multiple at once

**Part 2: Audience Cleanup**
1. Open Audiences dropdown
2. Review list of saved audiences
3. Find duplicate: "Hot Buyers" and "All Hot Buyers"
4. Compare criteria → Merge if identical
5. Delete redundant audience

**Part 3: Tag Hygiene**
1. Go to Tags view (or use search)
2. Search for #summer* → Find #summerlin, #sumerlin, #summrlin
3. Bulk select all with misspelled tag
4. Replace tag → Change to #summerlin
5. Delete unused tags

**Part 4: Archive Dead Contacts**
1. Create audience: "No activity in 2 years"
   - Last contact >730 days
   - No Keep in Touch reminders
2. Review list
3. Bulk select → Archive

**WHAT IF (Text)**

**Q: "How do I know if a contact should be archived vs deleted?"**
- A: Archive = temporarily remove from active database but keep record. Delete = permanently remove. Default to Archive unless it's clearly spam/duplicate.

**Q: "What if I have 500 contacts in 'Incomplete'?"**
- A: That's your 50-day project at 10 per day. Or tighten criteria: Only incomplete Fans/Advocates first, ignore Network for now.

**Q: "Can I automate any of this maintenance?"**
- A: Partially. Cloze will suggest duplicates automatically. You can create audiences that flag issues (SOI >60 days, Warm >6 months). But decisions still require human judgment.

**Q: "What if I clean everything up and it gets messy again?"**
- A: That's normal! Databases get messy with use. The monthly maintenance routine prevents it from becoming overwhelming. Think of it like laundry - it's never "done forever," but regular cycles keep it manageable.

**Q: "Should I delete old audiences or keep them?"**
- A: If you haven't used an audience in 6 months and don't have plans to, delete it. You can always recreate it if needed. Cluttered audience lists make the useful ones harder to find.

## MODULE 7: PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

### Your Segments & Audiences Action Plan

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

**Hook:** "You now know HOW to customize segments and create audiences. Here's WHAT to do first, in order, to get results fast."

**The Implementation Plan:**

Don't try to build your entire system today. Follow this sequence:

Week 1: Set up core audiences
Week 2: Audit and adjust segments
Week 3: Create marketing audiences
Week 4: Establish maintenance routine

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

### Your 4-Week Implementation Plan

**WEEK 1: ESSENTIAL AUDIENCES (Do These First)**

Create these 5 audiences:
1. ✅ **"Incomplete Contacts"** (Missing email OR mobile) → Your 10-per-day list
2. ✅ **"Buyers - Going Cold"** (Stage Warm + Last contact >30 days) → Weekly check
3. ✅ **"Advocates Need Love"** (Segment Advocate + Last contact >60 days) → Monthly VIP check
4. ✅ **"All Active Pipeline"** (Stage Warm OR Hot) → Daily review
5. ✅ **"No Segment Assigned"** (Segment = none) → Classify these

**Expected Result:** You now have automated lists for your highest priorities.

**WEEK 2: SEGMENT CUSTOMIZATION**

Tasks:
1. ✅ Review default Keep in Touch frequencies for each segment
2. ✅ Adjust if needed (Example: Advocates every 30 days instead of 45)
3. ✅ Decide if you need custom segments (Investor tiers, Vendor, etc.)
4. ✅ Create 1-2 custom segments if necessary
5. ✅ Move 20-30 contacts into appropriate segments to test

**Expected Result:** Segments now match your actual workflow.

**WEEK 3: MARKETING AUDIENCES**

Create audiences for your top marketing activities:
1. ✅ **Niche audience** (Tag #investor, #luxury, #firsttimebuyer - whichever you focus on)
2. ✅ **Geographic audience** (Tag #henderson, #summerlin - your target areas)
3. ✅ **VIP Listing Alert** (Fan/Advocate + Your niche tags + Has email)
4. ✅ **Re-engagement** (Network/Fan + Last contact >180 days)

**Expected Result:** You can now execute targeted campaigns in minutes.

**WEEK 4: MAINTENANCE ROUTINE**

Set up recurring calendar tasks:
1. ✅ **Weekly:** Check "Buyers Going Cold" audience → Reach out
2. ✅ **Weekly:** Check "Advocates Need Love" audience → Personal touch
3. ✅ **Monthly:** Segment audit (20 min)
4. ✅ **Monthly:** Tag hygiene (10 min)
5. ✅ **Quarterly:** Deep clean (1 hour)

**Expected Result:** System stays clean and useful long-term.

### Quick Wins You Can Do Today (30 Minutes)

**If you only have 30 minutes, do these 3 things:**

1. **Create "Incomplete Contacts" Audience** (5 min)
   - Missing email OR mobile
   - This becomes your 10-per-day list
   - Complete 10 right now

2. **Create "Buyers Going Cold" Audience** (5 min)
   - Stage = Warm + Last contact >30 days
   - Check it now, reach out to 3 people

3. **Audit Your Current Segments** (20 min)
   - Open 20 random contacts
   - Are they in the right segment?
   - Fix any that are wrong
   - Note patterns for segment customization later

**Result:** Immediate improvement in data quality and pipeline management.

**HOW (Video - 4-5 min)**

*Screen recording showing the Week 1 setup in real-time:*

1. Create "Incomplete Contacts" audience
2. Complete 3 contacts from it (demonstrate speed)
3. Create "Buyers Going Cold" audience
4. Review results, make sample call
5. Create "Advocates Need Love" audience
6. Show how these 3 audiences solve immediate problems

**Emphasize:**
- "This took 10 minutes to set up and will save you hours every week."
- "Check these audiences weekly and you'll never lose touch with important people."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

**Q: "What if I don't have time for the 4-week plan?"**
- A: Do Week 1 only. The 5 essential audiences give you 80% of the value. Add the rest when you're ready.

**Q: "Can I skip segment customization and just use default?"**
- A: Yes. Default Ninja Selling segments work great for most agents. Only customize if you have specific needs.

**Q: "What if I create audiences but don't use them?"**
- A: They're only useful if you CHECK them. Set calendar reminders: "Monday 9am: Check Buyers Going Cold audience." Make it a routine.

**Q: "Should I teach my team this system?"**
- A: Yes! If you're on a team plan, standardized segments and shared audiences keep everyone organized the same way. Have one person (you) set up the audiences, then share them.
