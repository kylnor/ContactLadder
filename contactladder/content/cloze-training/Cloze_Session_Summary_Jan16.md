## Decisions Made Today

### 1. Course Structure Finalized

We established a clear hierarchy for the training program:

```
ESSENTIALS
Goal: 10 contacts/day, Agenda 2x daily
Focus: Build the habit
    ↓
CONNECTIONS HUB (accessible anytime)
Goal: Get all your tools talking to Cloze
Focus: Integrations beyond the basics
    ↓
ADVANCED
Goal: Get your time back—do in 15 minutes what used to take an hour
Focus: Leverage and efficiency
    ↓
DEEP DIVES (standalone, as needed)
Focus: Specialized topics for specific needs
```

---

### 2. Connections Hub Architecture

**Decision:** The "Big Three" (Email, Phone, Calendar) stay in Essentials Module 0. The Connections Hub is a separate, always-accessible section for additional integrations.

**Rationale:** 
- Email/phone/calendar are *foundational*—Cloze barely works without them
- ActivePipe/RealScout are *enhancements*—Cloze works fine without them
- Agents may not have ActivePipe/RealScout set up on day one; they need access when ready

**Connections Hub will include:**
- Connect ActivePipe
- Connect RealScout
- Future integrations (Canva, Cloud CMA, HomeSpotter, DocuSign, Dotloop)

---

### 3. Advanced Course Goal

**Decision:** "Get your time back—do in 15 minutes what used to take an hour."

**Rationale:** 
- "Efficiency" is too vague
- Agents want time back, not abstract efficiency
- Every Advanced module can be framed as "here's how this saves you time"

---

### 4. Advanced Course Modules

Four modules, can be completed in any order:

| Module | What It Teaches | Time Savings |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| **A1: Audiences** | Save filters for one-click access | 5 min → 1 click |
| **A2: Mail Merge** | Personal emails at scale (<500 people) | 45 min → 5 min |
| **A3: Bulk Editing** | Change hundreds of contacts at once | 25 min → 30 sec |
| **A4: MAIA Basics** | AI for writing, reading, remembering | 5-10 min → 30 sec |

---

### 5. MAIA Module Scope

**Decision:** Module A4 covers three areas of MAIA:

1. **Writing** - Drafting emails, using the lightbulb/Ghostwriter, asking MAIA to compose
2. **Reading** - Timeline summaries, "Summarize what I know about [contact]"
3. **Remembering** - Adding notes via voice, creating reminders, drafting follow-ups

**Verified from help.cloze.com:**
- Timeline summaries appear in gray box above timeline (must enable in Settings)
- MAIA interaction: Phone = tap to speak, hold to type. Computer = tap to type, click mic to speak
- MAIA available on Platinum plan and above

---

### 6. Properties & Task Lists Placement

**Decision:** Both are Deep Dives, not part of Essentials or Advanced.

**Rationale:**
- **Properties:** Completely different tab, not essential for the daily habit, feels separate and intentional
- **Task Lists:** Touched lightly in Essentials (the existing steps), but customization is a power-user feature

---

### 7. Teams Placement

**Decision:** Teams is a Deep Dive, not part of Advanced.

**Rationale:** Not all agents work on teams. Those who do need dedicated training, not a rushed module.

---

### 8. Deep Dives List

Standalone courses for specialized topics:

| Deep Dive | Who It's For |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Properties** | Agents tracking listings/transactions in Cloze |
| **Task Lists** | Agents wanting custom buyer/seller checklists |
| **Templates & Campaigns** | Agents who send recurring emails or drip sequences |
| **Cloze AI Mastery** | Power users wanting advanced MAIA features |
| **Teams** | Team leads and admins |
| **Marketing Newsletters** | Agents doing their own email marketing |

---

### 9. Export to CSV for Postcards

**Decision:** This is a Deep Dive topic, not Advanced.

**Rationale:** Edge case—most agents won't need it, and those who do can find it in a specialized module.

## Open Questions

1. **Deep Dive Priority:** Which Deep Dive should we build first?
