**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| B | Wastes time on design | "You spend 20 minutes tweaking colors, fonts, button styles for each email. Theme does that for you in advance. Build emails in 5 minutes instead of 30." |

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

A Theme is your **design foundation** that controls:

- **Buttons:** Style, color, hover effects
- **Images:** Border radius, shadows, spacing
- **Links:** Color, underline style

**Why Use a Theme?**

2. **Speed:** Design decisions made once, not every time
3. **Professionalism:** Looks intentional, not random
4. **Team Alignment:** Everyone uses the same branding

**Recommended Theme Setup:**

## MODULE MN3: BUILDING BLOCKS

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| B | Forgets compliance footers | "You sent a newsletter and forgot the unsubscribe link. Building Blocks include your legal footer automatically so you never forget." |
| C | Wants team consistency | "Your three agents send newsletters with different headers and footers. Building Blocks ensure everyone uses the same professional branding." |

**Story to include:**

> "I spent 10 minutes adding my header. 5 minutes on the footer. Every single newsletter. Created Building Blocks once. Now I embed both. Two clicks. Zero design time. 15 minutes saved per newsletter. That's 3 hours per year!"

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**What Are Building Blocks?**

Building Blocks are **reusable design elements** you create once and embed in multiple emails. Think of them as templates within templates.

**Common Building Blocks:**

| **Legal Footer** | Unsubscribe link, address, compliance text | Required for mass email |
| **Property Card** | Property photo, price, beds/baths, CTA | Reusable listing showcase |
| **Testimonial** | Client photo, quote, attribution | Social proof |

**Why Use Building Blocks?**

1. **Consistency:** Same header/footer every time
2. **Speed:** Embed instead of rebuild
3. **Updates:** Update the block once, it updates in all emails (future sends)
4. **Team Alignment:** Everyone uses the same blocks

| A | Procrastinates on newsletters | "You know you should send a monthly newsletter. You put it off because it's too much work. AI generates the entire newsletter in 30 seconds. No more excuses." |
| B | Not a writer | "You're not a content creator. AI writes the headlines, the intro, the market update, the closing. You just tweak and send." |
| C | Wants to test fast | "You want to try different newsletter topics without spending hours writing each one. AI lets you generate 3 different newsletters in 5 minutes and pick the best." |

**Story to include:**

> "I avoided newsletters for months. They took an hour to write. Told MAIA my goal. 30 seconds later: complete newsletter with headlines, content, structure. I added my logo. Real photos. Sent. 4 minutes total. Now I send monthly. It's actually easy!"

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

```
NEWSLETTER STRUCTURE:

SECTION 1: HEADLINE
"Your Guide to Buying Your First Home in Las Vegas"

SECTION 2: INTRO
Welcome! If you're thinking about buying your first home in Las Vegas, you're in the right place. The market is competitive, but with the right information and support, you can find a great home within your budget. Here's what you need to know.

SECTION 3: TIP 1 - UNDERSTAND DOWN PAYMENT OPTIONS
Article: "You don't need 20% down"
Summary: Many first-time buyers think they need a huge down payment. FHA loans require as little as 3.5%, and there are down payment assistance programs available in Nevada.

SECTION 4: TIP 2 - GET PRE-APPROVED EARLY
Article: "Pre-approval gives you an edge"
Summary: In a competitive market, sellers want to see that you're serious and financially ready. Pre-approval shows you can afford the home and speeds up the buying process.

SECTION 5: TIP 3 - EXPLORE AFFORDABLE NEIGHBORHOODS
Article: "Best neighborhoods for first-time buyers"
Summary: Neighborhoods like North Las Vegas, parts of Henderson, and emerging areas offer great value for first-time buyers. You can find quality homes under $350k.

SECTION 6: TIP 4 - WORK WITH A LOCAL AGENT
Why it matters: A local agent knows the market, can spot good deals, and will guide you through the entire process from search to close.

SECTION 7: TIP 5 - BUDGET FOR MORE THAN THE MORTGAGE
Don't forget: Homeownership includes property taxes, HOA fees (if applicable), insurance, and maintenance. Budget for the full cost of ownership.

SECTION 8: CALL-TO-ACTION
Ready to start your home search? I'd love to help. Schedule a free buyer consultation and let's find your perfect first home.

SECTION 9: FOOTER

4. Add images:
   - Section 1: Las Vegas welcome sign
   - Section 3: Happy family in front of house

**Pro Tip:**

> "Use AI to overcome writer's block and get a strong first draft fast. Then add your expertise. Local market insights. Specific property examples. Personal stories. AI plus you equals a newsletter that actually gets read. Why this matters: 12 newsletters per year. AI saves you 10 hours annually."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if the AI-generated content is generic?"
  - A: Always customize! Add local market data, specific examples, your personal insights. AI gives you the structure and filler, you add the value.

- Q: "What if AI includes wrong information?"
  - A: Always fact-check. AI can make mistakes. Verify stats, dates, and advice before sending.

- Q: "Can I generate newsletters on any topic?"
  - A: Yes—market updates, buying/selling tips, neighborhood guides, investment advice, etc. The more specific your prompt, the better the output.

- Q: "What if I don't like the AI-generated newsletter?"
  - A: Tap "Rewrite" or start over with a different prompt. Or build manually without AI.

- Q: "Can AI pull live market data?"
  - A: AI uses general knowledge and may suggest where to find data, but you'll need to manually insert current stats from your MLS or market reports.

### Deliver and Measure Results

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| C | Needs follow-up system | "Someone opened your newsletter 3 times and clicked your featured listing. That's a hot signal. Tracking identifies who to follow up with." |

**Story to include:**

> "I sent a Just Listed email to 200 past clients. 85 opens. 12 clicks on the listing. I followed up with the 12 who clicked. 'Hey Sarah, saw you checked out my new listing. Know anyone looking?' Got 3 referrals. Tracking told me exactly who to call!"

*Screen recording showing:*

**Part 1: Selecting Your Audience**

1. Go to People
2. Create or select an Audience/Segment:
   - Example: Segment = Past Client
   - OR: Tag = #newsletter
   - OR: Audience = "Advocates + Fans"
3. Select all (or select specific contacts)
4. Shows: "237 contacts selected"

**Part 2: Sending the Newsletter**

1. Tap checkmark icon → "Mail Merge" → "Marketing Email"
2. Select your newsletter template (or create new)
3. Review:
   - Subject Line: "Your December Market Update 🏡"
   - Preview Text: "Home sales, market trends, and featured listings"
   - Sender Name: Your Name
   - Reply-to: Your Email
4. Tap "Preview" to see what recipients will see
5. Send test email to yourself
6. Review test email
7. Tap "Send" (or "Schedule" for later delivery)
8. Confirm send: "Send to 237 contacts?"
9. Send

**Part 3: Monitoring Sends**

1. Newsletter starts sending (may take a few minutes for large lists)
2. Go to Sent folder
3. See the sent newsletter
4. Shows:
   - Sent to: 237
   - Delivered: 235 (2 bounces)
   - Opens: Updating in real-time

**Part 4: Viewing Individual Tracking**

1. Open a contact: "Sarah Martinez"
2. Look at timeline
3. See newsletter activity:
   - ✉️ "Sent: December Market Update" (Jan 15, 9:03am)
   - 👁️ "Opened" (Jan 15, 9:17am)
   - 👁️ "Opened" (Jan 15, 2:43pm)
   - 🔗 "Clicked: Featured Listing" (Jan 15, 2:44pm)

**Part 5: Following Up on Engagement**

1. Create a View: "Opened December Newsletter"
2. Filter: Opened email = "December Market Update"
3. Shows all contacts who opened
4. Further filter: Clicked link = Yes
5. Shows 12 contacts who clicked
6. Follow up with personal outreach:
   - "Hi Sarah, saw you checked out the featured listing on Sunset Drive. Want to see it this weekend?"

**Pro Tip:**

> "Use tracking to identify your most engaged contacts. Someone who opens every newsletter and clicks links? That's a warm lead even if they're not actively buying or selling yet. Prioritize outreach to them. Why this matters: The 20% most engaged contacts generate 80% of your referrals. Track them. Nurture them."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if someone doesn't open the newsletter?"
  - A: Not everyone checks email immediately. Wait 3-5 days, then check again. Low opens may mean bad subject line or wrong audience.

- Q: "Can I resend to people who didn't open?"
  - A: Yes—create a View of "Did NOT open December Newsletter" and resend with a different subject line.

- Q: "What if open rates are low?"
  - A: Test different subject lines, send times (Tuesday-Thursday 9-11am often works best), and make sure your content is valuable.

- Q: "Can I see which specific links got clicked?"
  - A: Yes—in the sent email report, see link performance (which buttons/links had the most clicks).

- Q: "What's a good open rate for newsletters?"
  - A: 20-30% is average for real estate. 40%+ is excellent. Anything under 15% means something's wrong (subject line, audience, or email deliverability).

## MODULE MN7: LEAD CAPTURE FORMS

### Turn Your Website Into a Lead Generation Machine

**WHY (Video - 3-4 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Gets web leads via email | "Someone fills out your website contact form. You get an email. You manually copy their info into Cloze. You respond 2 hours later. Lead Capture Forms skip all that—leads flow directly into Cloze and get instant auto-response." |
| B | Uses third-party forms | "You're using Wufoo or Google Forms to capture leads, then exporting to CSV and importing to Cloze monthly. Lead Capture Forms connect your website straight to your CRM in real-time." |
| C | Wants faster follow-up | "The faster you respond to a web lead, the higher your conversion rate. Lead Capture Forms trigger instant auto-responses and create Next Steps so you never miss a hot lead." |

**Story to include:**

> "Website leads came via email. I'd copy their info into Cloze manually. Respond 3 hours later. By then they'd already contacted three other agents. With Lead Capture Forms: leads go straight to Cloze. Auto-tagged. Instant response. Next Step created. I respond in 10 minutes. Conversion doubled!"

7. John says: "Wow, you responded fast and remembered everything!"
8. Higher conversion because you were fast and prepared

**Pro Tip:**

> "Set a goal: Respond to ALL web leads within 30 minutes. Studies show response time is the number one factor in lead conversion. Someone who waits 3 hours will contact 5 other agents. Someone who gets a call in 10 minutes picks YOU. Why this matters: Speed wins deals. Period."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if I don't have a website?"
  - A: Use the Cloze-hosted form URL and share it on social media, in email signatures, or via text. It works as a standalone landing page.

- Q: "What if I want to qualify leads before they hit my CRM?"
  - A: Add a field like "Are you pre-approved?" or "Timeline?" Use the data to prioritize follow-up, but all leads still get added to Cloze.

- Q: "Can I send form submissions to a specific team member?"
  - A: Yes—in form settings, auto-assign submissions to a team member. Example: Buyer forms → Sarah, Seller forms → Mike.

- Q: "What if someone submits the form multiple times?"
  - A: Cloze updates the existing contact instead of creating duplicates (matches by email). Each submission is logged in the timeline.

- Q: "Can I embed forms on landing pages built with Leadpages or Unbounce?"
  - A: Yes—use the HTML embed code in those tools. Most landing page builders support custom HTML.

- Q: "What if I want to track which ad campaign the lead came from?"
  - A: Use UTM parameters in your ad URLs. Example: yoursite.com/contact?utm_source=facebook. Cloze can capture and tag based on UTM parameters.

- Q: "What if form spam is a problem?"
  - A: Enable CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA in form settings to block bots.

- Q: "Can I see which forms are converting best?"
  - A: Yes—form analytics show submission counts, conversion rates, and sources. Use this to double down on what works.
