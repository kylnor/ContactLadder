## MODULE TM1: THE FOUR SHARING METHODS

### Understanding Your Options

**WHY (Video - 3-4 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Confused about team features | "Cloze has four ways to share contacts. Each serves a different purpose. Pick the wrong one and you'll share too much or too little. Let's break them down so you choose right every time." |
| B | Frustrated by duplication | "You called a lead. Your teammate called the same lead 2 hours later. Embarrassing. Sharing prevents duplicate outreach and keeps everyone aligned." |
| C | Wants to scale | "You can't grow a team if everyone's working in silos. Shared contacts, shared context, shared wins—that's how teams scale without chaos." |

**Story to include:**

> "Hired my first buyer agent. We tripped over each other. Both calling the same leads. Set up Agent Team sharing. Now we see each other's timelines. Stopped duplicating. Started collaborating."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**The Four Sharing Methods in Cloze:**

| Method | Best For | What Gets Shared | Duration |
|--------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Agent Team** | Ongoing collaboration with multiple users | Contacts, timeline activity, projects, deals | Permanent (until un-shared) |
| **Deal (Project) Team** | Time-bound collaboration on transactions | Project-specific contacts and timeline | For the duration of the deal |
| **Inner Circle** | Small, trusted team (usually 2 people) | Email, calls, texts, notes for shared contacts | Permanent automatic sharing |
| **Delegate Access** | Assistants, VAs, marketing support | Configurable—you control what they see/do | Permanent (until revoked) |

**Comparison:**

```
AGENT TEAM:
You + Buyer Agent + Listing Agent
Share all buyers, sellers, database
Everyone sees timeline, can add notes
Great for: Real estate teams, shared client management

DEAL TEAM:
You + Transaction Coordinator + Lender + Title Rep
Share contacts related to 123 Main St transaction
See deal-specific activity only
Great for: Managing specific deals with collaborators

INNER CIRCLE:
You + Spouse (also in RE) OR You + Admin Assistant
Automatically share all emails/calls/texts for mutual contacts
Contact records stay private
Great for: Tight partnerships, 2-person teams

DELEGATE ACCESS:
You + Virtual Assistant
You control exactly what they can see and do
They work "on your behalf"
Great for: Admin support, marketing help
```

**Key Insight:**

> "Agent Team = ongoing collaboration on all clients. Deal Team = temporary collaboration on one deal. Inner Circle = automatic sharing with one trusted person. Delegate = giving someone access to help you without full team membership. Why this matters: You've got 40 hours a week. Stop spending them coordinating via text and email. Let Cloze show everyone what they need to see automatically."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "Use multiple methods?"
  - A: Yes—combine Agent Team + Deal Teams.

- Q: "Un-share later?"
  - A: Yes—reversible.

- Q: "Someone leaves team?"
  - A: Remove them. Access ends.

- Q: "See who has access?"
  - A: Check sharing icons on contact.

---

## MODULE TM2: AGENT TEAM

### Ongoing Collaboration with Your Core Team

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Team works in silos | "Your buyer agent has 30 active buyers. You have 15 listings. You're both calling leads without knowing who the other has touched. Agent Team fixes this—one shared database, full transparency." |
| B | Wastes time on updates | "'What's the status on the Johnsons?' 'Did you follow up with Sarah?' Stop playing phone tag with your team. Agent Team shows everyone the latest activity automatically." |
| C | Wants accountability | "Who's handling this lead? Who was supposed to call them back? Agent Team lets you assign responsibility so everyone knows their lane." |

**Story to include:**

> "My listing specialist handled sellers. I focused on buyers. Before Agent Team? Fifty texts a day. 'What's the status?' 'Did you call them back?' With Agent Team: I assign the contact. She sees full context. Takes over. Clean handoff. Zero texts needed!"

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**Agent Team Features:**

- **Shared Contacts:** All team members see the same contact database
- **Shared Timeline:** Everyone sees emails, calls, texts, notes, meetings
- **Assignment:** Assign contacts to team members (shows who's responsible)
- **Shared Projects & Deals:** Collaborate on transactions
- **Contact Sync:** Updates made by one person appear for everyone
- **Permission Controls:** Admin can control what team members can see/edit

**What Gets Shared:**

| Data | Shared? | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Contact name, email, phone | ✅ Yes | Everyone sees basic contact info |
| Timeline (emails, calls, texts) | ✅ Yes (configurable) | You control what activity is shared |
| Notes & At a Glance | ✅ Yes | Shared by default |
| Tags | ✅ Yes | Everyone sees and can add tags |
| Segments & Stages | ✅ Yes | Shared classification |
| Next Steps | ✅ Yes | Everyone sees active Next Steps |
| Projects & Deals | ✅ Yes | Shared transactions |

**What Stays Private (Unless Shared):**

- Your personal calendar (calendar events are shared if related to shared contacts)

**Automatic Sharing by Segment:**

You can set default sharing rules:

## MODULE TM3: DEAL (PROJECT) TEAM

### Collaborate on Specific Transactions

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Manages complex transactions | "You're coordinating with a lender, title rep, inspector, and transaction coordinator on one deal. Deal Team brings everyone together without giving them access to your entire database." |
| B | Wants time-limited sharing | "You don't need your lender to see all your contacts forever. You need them to see THIS buyer for THIS deal. Deal Team shares project-specific info only." |
| C | Prevents information overload | "Your transaction coordinator doesn't need to see 500 contacts. They need to see the 5 people involved in this one transaction. Deal Team gives them exactly what they need, nothing more." |

**Story to include:**

> "Complex transaction. Difficult lender. Picky inspector. First-time buyers freaking out. Created a Deal Team. Everyone saw the timeline. TC coordinated deadlines. Lender saw buyer communication. We closed on time. Without Deal Team? That deal would've fallen apart."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**Deal (Project) Team Features:**

- **Project-Specific Sharing:** Only contacts and activity related to THIS deal are shared
- **Time-Bound:** Sharing lasts for the duration of the deal (configurable)
- **Role-Based:** Add specific people to specific deals
- **Limited Scope:** Team members don't see your full database, just this project

**Use Cases:**

| Deal Type | Who's on the Team | What They See |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| **Buyer Transaction** | You, buyer, lender, inspector, TC | Buyer contact, property, timeline, documents, deadlines |
| **Listing Transaction** | You, seller, photographer, stager, co-listing agent | Seller contact, property, marketing timeline, showing activity |
| **Property Management** | You, owner, tenant, property manager | Property details, maintenance requests, lease info |

**What Gets Shared in a Deal Team:**

- **Property/Project Details:** Address, price, close date, milestones
- **Related Contacts:** Buyer, seller, agents, lender, title, etc.
- **Timeline Activity:** Emails, calls, notes, documents related to THIS deal
- **Next Steps:** Tasks and deadlines for this transaction
- **Documents:** Contracts, reports, disclosures uploaded to the deal

**What Stays Private:**

- Your other contacts and deals
- Timeline activity unrelated to this project
- Your full database

**HOW to Create and Manage a Deal Team (Video - 5-6 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

**Part 1: Creating a Deal/Project**

1. Go to Properties (or Projects)
2. Tap + icon → "Create Transaction" or "Create Deal"
3. Enter deal details:
   - Property: 123 Main Street
   - Type: Buyer Transaction
   - Buyer: Emily Johnson (link contact)
   - Close Date: March 15, 2025
4. Save the deal

**Part 2: Adding Team Members to the Deal**

1. Open the deal: "123 Main Street - Buyer Transaction"
2. Tap "Team" or "Collaborators"
3. Add team members:
   - **Lender:** John Smith (enter email or link existing contact)
   - **Transaction Coordinator:** Sarah Lee
   - **Inspector:** ABC Inspections
   - **Title Rep:** Jane Doe
4. For each team member, set sharing level:
   - **Full Timeline:** See all activity related to this deal
   - **Deal Details Only:** See property info, contacts, milestones (not full timeline)
   - **Limited:** See only what you assign them
5. Save

**Part 3: What Team Members See**

1. Lender (John Smith) receives notification: "You've been added to a deal: 123 Main Street"
2. John opens Cloze → sees the deal in his Projects
3. John sees:
   - Property details (address, price, close date)
   - Buyer contact: Emily Johnson
   - Timeline: Emails with Emily, documents uploaded, inspection scheduled
   - Next Steps: "Appraisal due by Feb 20"
4. John does NOT see:
   - Your other deals
   - Your other contacts
   - Activity unrelated to 123 Main Street

**Part 4: Collaborating on the Deal**

1. Inspector uploads inspection report to the deal
2. Everyone on the Deal Team sees it
3. You email Emily about inspection results
4. Lender sees the email in the timeline (because it's related to this deal)
5. TC creates Next Step: "Inspection contingency decision due in 7 days"
6. Everyone gets reminders

**Part 5: Ending Deal Team Access**

1. Deal closes
2. Go to Deal Team settings
3. Choose:
   - **End Sharing Now:** Team members lose access immediately
   - **End Sharing in 30 days:** Team members have access for 30 days post-close
   - **Keep Sharing:** Team members keep access indefinitely (not recommended for lenders/title)
4. Save

**Pro Tip:**

> "Use Deal Teams for every transaction. Bring in your TC, lender, title rep. Anyone who needs to collaborate. Give them exactly the access they need for THIS deal. Remove access when it's done. Clean. Organized. Professional. Why this matters: You'll manage 30-50 deals per year. Deal Teams keep each one organized without exposing your entire database."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if I have multiple deals and want the same lender on all of them?"
  - A: Add them to each Deal Team individually. They'll see each deal separately, not all at once.

- Q: "What if a Deal Team member needs to see my full database?"
  - A: That's not what Deal Team is for—use Agent Team for full database access. Deal Team is for project-specific collaboration.

- Q: "Can I add someone to a Deal Team if they don't have a Cloze account?"
  - A: Yes—invite them. They'll create a free Cloze account (if needed) to access the deal.

- Q: "What if I accidentally add someone to the wrong deal?"
  - A: Remove them from the Deal Team. They lose access immediately.

- Q: "Can I use Deal Teams for non-real estate projects?"
  - A: Yes—Projects/Deals work for any type of project. Use it for events, marketing campaigns, whatever needs team collaboration.

## MODULE TM4: INNER CIRCLE

### Automatic Sharing for Your Closest Partner

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Works with spouse/partner | "You and your spouse both work in real estate. You're constantly texting each other: 'Did you call Sarah?' 'What did Mike say?' Inner Circle automatically shares your activity so you both stay in sync." |
| B | Has an admin assistant | "Your assistant needs to see your emails and calls to manage your schedule and follow-ups. Inner Circle gives them automatic access without manual sharing every time." |
| C | Small, tight team | "For a 2-person team where you both need to see everything, Inner Circle is perfect. No manual sharing, no setup—it just works." |

**Story to include:**

> "My husband and I both sell real estate. We duplicated outreach constantly. Both calling the same person. Embarrassing. Set up Inner Circle. Now we see each other's activity automatically. No more duplicate calls. True partnership on autopilot."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**Inner Circle Features:**

- **Automatic Activity Sharing:** If you both have the same contact (matched by email or phone), you automatically see each other's emails, calls, texts, notes
- **Contact Records Stay Private:** Your contact list, tags, At a Glance—private unless you manually share
- **No Manual Sharing Required:** Set it up once, it works forever
- **Ideal for 2-Person Teams:** Best for small, trusted partnerships

**How It Works:**

```
YOU have contact: Sarah Martinez (sarah@email.com)
YOUR PARTNER also has contact: Sarah Martinez (sarah@email.com)
   ↓
INNER CIRCLE ACTIVATES:
   - You email Sarah → Partner sees your email in their timeline
   - Partner calls Sarah → You see the call in your timeline
   - Both see shared activity, but your contact lists stay separate
```

**What Gets Shared (Automatically):**

| Activity | Shared? |
|----------|---------|
| Emails | ✅ Yes (if both have contact) |
| Calls | ✅ Yes (if both have contact) |
| Texts | ✅ Yes (if both have contact) |
| Notes | ✅ Yes (if both have contact) |
| Meetings | ✅ Yes (if both have contact) |

**What Stays Private:**

| Data | Shared? |
|------|---------|
| Contact lists | ❌ No—your contacts are yours |
| Tags | ❌ No—your tagging is private |
| At a Glance | ❌ No—your notes are private |
| Segments | ❌ No—your classification is private |

**Key Insight:**

> "Inner Circle is like having one shared timeline for every mutual contact, but separate contact databases. You organize your way. Your partner organizes their way. But you both see the same activity. Why this matters: Perfect for 2-person teams who need full visibility without managing permissions."

**HOW to Set Up Inner Circle (Video - 3-4 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

**Part 1: Enabling Inner Circle**

1. Go to More → Settings → Sharing (or Team Settings)
2. Find "Inner Circle"
3. Tap "Set Up Inner Circle"
4. Enter your partner's email: partner@example.com
5. Send invitation
6. Partner accepts invitation
7. Inner Circle is now active

**Part 2: How It Works in Practice**

1. You add a new contact: "Alex Johnson" with email alex@email.com
2. Your partner also has Alex Johnson with the same email
3. Inner Circle automatically links the two records
4. You email Alex → Your partner sees your email on Alex's timeline in their Cloze
5. Your partner calls Alex → You see the call on Alex's timeline in your Cloze

**Part 3: Viewing Shared Activity**

1. Open a contact: "Sarah Martinez"
2. Look at the timeline
3. See activity from both you AND your Inner Circle partner:
   - ✉️ Email from YOU (Jan 10)
   - 📞 Call from PARTNER (Jan 12)
   - 📧 Email from PARTNER (Jan 14)
4. You see everything, they see everything

**Part 4: Managing Inner Circle**

1. To remove Inner Circle: Settings → Sharing → Inner Circle → "Disable"
2. Shared activity stops syncing (historical activity remains)

**Pro Tip:**

> "Inner Circle is set-it-and-forget-it. Perfect for spouses, business partners, or you plus one trusted assistant. For bigger teams, use Agent Team instead. The result: True partnership without the coordination overhead."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if my partner has a contact with the same name but different email?"
  - A: Inner Circle matches by email or phone number. If the email/phone doesn't match, the contacts aren't linked.

- Q: "What if I want to share a contact but my partner doesn't have them?"
  - A: Inner Circle only shares activity for MUTUAL contacts. If your partner doesn't have the contact, use manual sharing or Agent Team.

- Q: "Can I have multiple Inner Circle partners?"
  - A: Typically Inner Circle is designed for one trusted person. For multiple collaborators, use Agent Team.

- Q: "What if I don't want to share activity for a specific contact?"
  - A: You'd need to disable Inner Circle or ensure the contact info doesn't match (use a different email). Inner Circle is all-or-nothing for mutual contacts.

- Q: "Can I see what contacts are shared via Inner Circle?"
  - A: Contacts with the same email/phone in both accounts are automatically linked. Check the timeline for activity from your Inner Circle partner.

## MODULE TM5: DELEGATE ACCESS

### Give Assistants and Support Staff Controlled Access

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Hires first assistant | "You're drowning in admin work. Your new VA can help—if they have access to your Cloze. Delegate Access gives them controlled access without making them a full team member." |
| B | Worried about security | "You need help but you're nervous about giving someone full access to your database. Delegate Access lets you control exactly what they can see and do." |
| C | Wants to scale | "You can't grow if you're doing everything yourself. Delegate routine tasks to an assistant while you focus on revenue-generating activities." |

**Story to include:**

> "My VA handles social media and email marketing. She needed access to my Advocate list. Not my Hot Buyers. Not my deals. Just Advocates. Delegate Access gave her exactly what she needed. Nothing more. She works. I control. Everyone wins."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**Delegate Access Features:**

- **Controlled Access:** You decide exactly what the delegate can see and do
- **Work on Your Behalf:** Delegate acts as you (emails appear from your account)
- **No Full Team Membership:** Delegate doesn't become a full team member with their own contact database
- **Revocable:** You can remove access anytime

**What You Can Grant Access To:**

| Permission | What It Means |
|------------|--------------|
| **View Specific Segments** | Delegate sees only Buyers, or only Advocates, etc. |
| **View All Contacts** | Delegate sees your full database |
| **Send Emails** | Delegate can send emails from your account |
| **Create/Edit Contacts** | Delegate can add or modify contacts |
| **View Timeline** | Delegate can see email/call history |
| **Manage Calendar** | Delegate can schedule meetings for you |
| **Limited Access** | Delegate can only perform specific tasks you define |

**What Delegate CANNOT Do (Unless Granted):**

- Change your password or account settings
- Delete contacts permanently
- Access billing or subscription settings
- See activity outside their granted permissions

**Common Delegate Roles:**

| Role | What They Need | Permissions to Grant |
|------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Admin Assistant** | Manage schedule, follow-ups | View contacts, calendar, send emails, view timeline |
| **Marketing VA** | Send newsletters, social posts | View specific segments (Advocates, Past Clients), send marketing emails |
| **Transaction Coordinator** | Manage deal milestones | View In Contract contacts, access Properties, edit Next Steps |
| **Data Entry VA** | Clean up database | Create/edit contacts, limited timeline access |

**HOW to Set Up Delegate Access (Video - 4-5 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

**Part 1: Inviting a Delegate**

1. Go to More → Settings → Team (or Delegate Access)
2. Tap "Invite Delegate" or "Add Delegate"
3. Enter delegate's email: assistant@example.com
4. Select delegate role/permissions:
   - **View Contacts:** Choose segments (e.g., "Advocates," "Past Clients")
   - **Send Emails:** Yes
   - **View Timeline:** Yes (for selected contacts)
   - **Edit Contacts:** Yes
   - **Manage Calendar:** No
5. Send invitation
6. Delegate accepts and gains access

**Part 2: What the Delegate Sees**

1. Delegate logs into Cloze
2. Sees only the contacts/segments you granted access to
3. Can perform only the actions you permitted
4. Cannot see your full database or change settings

**Part 3: Delegate Sends an Email**

1. Delegate opens a contact: "John Smith" (in Advocates segment)
2. Clicks "Email"
3. Writes email
4. Sends—email comes from YOUR email address, not the delegate's
5. You see the sent email in your Sent folder and John's timeline

**Part 4: Monitoring Delegate Activity**

1. Go to Settings → Delegate Access → View Activity
2. See what the delegate has done:
   - Emails sent
   - Contacts created/edited
   - Timeline viewed
3. Review for quality control

**Part 5: Revoking Delegate Access**

1. Go to Settings → Delegate Access
2. Find the delegate
3. Tap "Revoke Access" or "Remove"
4. Delegate loses access immediately

**Pro Tip:**

> "Start with minimal permissions. Add more as needed. It's easier to grant more access later than to clean up mistakes from granting too much upfront. Why this matters: One bad email sent from your account can cost you a client."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if my delegate sends a bad email from my account?"
  - A: You're responsible for everything sent from your account. Train your delegate, review their work initially, and revoke access if needed.

- Q: "Can I have multiple delegates with different permissions?"
  - A: Yes—you can have a marketing VA with access to Advocates, and a TC with access to In Contract deals. Each gets their own permissions.

- Q: "What if I want to see everything my delegate does?"
  - A: Check the activity log in Delegate Access settings. You can see all actions taken.

- Q: "Can my delegate give someone else access?"
  - A: No—only you (the account owner) can grant or revoke access.

- Q: "What if my delegate needs temporary access for a specific project?"
  - A: Grant access for the project, then revoke when done. You control the duration.

## MODULE TM6: SHARED INBOXES & TEAM EMAIL

### Manage Team Email Addresses Together

**WHY (Video - 3-4 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Multiple people handle inquiries | "You have an info@yourbrokerage.com email. Three people check it. Someone replies. Two hours later, someone else replies to the same email because they didn't know it was handled. Shared Inbox fixes this." |
| B | Wants accountability | "'Who responded to that lead from our website?' You're searching through sent folders hoping someone handled it. Shared Inbox shows exactly who responded, when, and what they said." |
| C | Overwhelmed by volume | "50 inquiries a day to your team email. You can't handle them all alone. Distribute the load across your team with assignment and visibility." |

**Story to include:**

> "Team email was chaos. Duplicate responses. Lost leads. Set up Shared Inbox. We mark emails as handled. Assign to specialists. Response time went from 6 hours to 30 minutes. Conversion up 40%. That's real money!"

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**What Is a Shared Inbox?**

A Shared Inbox is a team email address (info@, support@, team@, etc.) that multiple team members can access, respond from, and collaborate on—all within Cloze.

**Shared Inbox Features:**

| Feature | What It Does | Benefit |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Unified View** | All team members see the same inbox | No duplicate responses |
| **Assignment** | Assign emails to specific team members | Clear accountability |
| **Status Tracking** | Mark emails as Open, In Progress, Resolved | Know what's handled |
| **Collaborative Notes** | Add internal notes invisible to client | Team coordination |
| **Response Visibility** | See who responded and when | No confusion |
| **Auto-Routing** | Route emails based on keywords or sender | Smart distribution |

**Use Cases:**

| Inbox | Who Manages It | Use Case |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| **info@yourbrokerage.com** | Entire team | General inquiries, website leads |
| **support@yourbrokerage.com** | Admin team | Client support, questions |
| **listings@yourbrokerage.com** | Listing agents | Listing inquiries, showing requests |
| **buyers@yourbrokerage.com** | Buyer agents | Buyer leads, property questions |

**How It Works:**

```
LEAD emails: info@yourbrokerage.com
   ↓
SHARED INBOX in Cloze:
- All team members see the email
- Someone assigns it to themselves or it's auto-assigned
- They respond from info@yourbrokerage.com
- Email marked as "Resolved"
- Everyone sees it was handled
   ↓
NO DUPLICATE RESPONSES:
- Team member #2 sees it's already resolved
- Skips it, moves to next inquiry
```

   - **Assign to:** Sarah (Buyer Agent)
3. Create rule:
   - **If email contains:** "listing" OR "sell my home"
   - **Assign to:** Mike (Listing Agent)
4. Save rules
5. Incoming emails auto-route based on keywords

**Part 5: Responding from Shared Inbox**

1. Sarah opens an assigned email: "John Smith - Looking to buy"
2. Clicks "Reply"
3. Writes response
4. Email sends **FROM: info@yourbrokerage.com** (not Sarah's personal email)
5. John sees response from team email, not Sarah's personal address
6. Sarah marks email as "Resolved"
7. Team sees it's handled, moves on

**Part 6: Using Status Tags**

1. Email comes in: "Question about 123 Main St listing"
2. Mike sees it, starts drafting response
3. Marks status as **"In Progress"**
4. Other team members see it's being handled, don't duplicate effort
5. Mike sends response
6. Marks status as **"Resolved"**
7. Email archived or moved to "Resolved" folder

**Part 7: Collaborative Notes (Internal Team Communication)**

1. Email from lead: "Interested in homes under $500k in Summerlin"
2. Sarah reads it, adds **Internal Note:** "This is a warm lead—called us last month. Follow up ASAP."
3. Note is visible to team in Cloze, but NOT visible to the lead
4. Mike sees the note, prioritizes the response
5. Responds within 15 minutes

**Part 8: Tracking Team Performance**

1. Go to Shared Inbox → Analytics (or Reports)
2. See metrics:
   - **Average response time:** 45 minutes
   - **Emails handled per team member:**
     - Sarah: 18
     - Mike: 22
     - Jessica: 10
   - **Resolution rate:** 95%
   - **Pending emails:** 3
3. Use data to balance workload and improve performance

**Pro Tip:**

> "Use auto-assignment rules for common inquiry types. 'Buyer,' 'listing,' 'support' keywords route emails to the right person instantly. No manual sorting. Faster response times. The result: Leads get answered by the right specialist in minutes instead of hours."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if two people start responding to the same email?"
  - A: Use status tags. When you start working on an email, mark it "In Progress." Others see it's being handled and skip it.

- Q: "What if I want to respond from my personal email instead of the shared inbox?"
  - A: You can, but it defeats the purpose of shared inbox transparency. Best practice: respond from the shared address so the team sees it was handled.

- Q: "Can I have multiple shared inboxes?"
  - A: Yes—connect info@, support@, listings@, etc. Each can have different team access and assignment rules.

- Q: "What if a team member leaves and we need to reassign their emails?"
  - A: Filter by "Assigned to [Former Team Member]," select all, reassign to someone else.

- Q: "Can I see response times for each team member?"
  - A: Yes—Shared Inbox analytics show average response time per person. Use this for accountability and performance reviews.

- Q: "What if an email needs input from multiple people?"
  - A: Use internal notes to tag team members: "@Mike can you weigh in on this pricing question?" Mike gets notified.

- Q: "Can I set up auto-responses for shared inboxes?"
  - A: Yes—create an auto-reply: "Thanks for contacting us. We'll respond within 24 hours." This buys you time and sets expectations.

- Q: "What if I want certain emails to go to specific people automatically?"
  - A: Use auto-assignment rules with filters. Example: Emails from @zillow.com → assign to Sarah (Zillow lead specialist).
