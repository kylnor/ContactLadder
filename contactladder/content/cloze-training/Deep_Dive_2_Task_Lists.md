## DEEP DIVE OVERVIEW

**Goal:** Master Next Steps and Task Lists to create custom buyer/seller workflows that move clients through your process automatically.

**Who This Is For:** Agents who want to customize and automate their buyer consultation process, listing presentation workflow, transaction checklists, and post-close follow-up sequences.

**Prerequisites:**
- Completed Cloze Essentials (or actively using Segments and Stages)
- Understanding of your current buyer/seller process

**Time to Complete:** 30-45 minutes

**The Promise:**

> "Stop forgetting steps in buyer consultations. Stop missing seller follow-ups. Task Lists turn your best process into a repeatable checklist with automatic reminders. Build once. Use forever. Never drop the ball. No forgotten steps. No dropped balls."

---

## MODULE T1: UNDERSTANDING NEXT STEPS

### Your Workflow, Automated

**WHY (Video - 3-4 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Inconsistent process | "You handle each buyer differently. Sometimes you remember the buyer guide. Sometimes you forget. By buyer number 5, you're dropping steps left and right. Next Steps make your process consistent. Every single client. Every single time. No exceptions." |
| B | Overwhelmed by tasks | "You're juggling 8 buyers, 3 listings, 2 deals in contract. Can't remember where each one is in your process. Next Steps show you exactly what to do next for every single client!" |
| C | Wants to scale | "You can only handle so many clients because you're tracking everything in your head. Next Steps let you handle twice as many clients without dropping the ball. Scale without losing quality." |

**Story to include:**

> "Had a buyer process I loved. Send guide. Schedule consultation. Review pre-approval. Lender referrals. Schedule showings. Did it perfectly for buyer #1. By buyer #5, I'd forget steps left and right. Next Steps turned my process into a checklist. Every buyer gets the same VIP experience. No exceptions. Cloze remembers everything."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**What Are Next Steps?**

Repeatable checklists that follow your workflow and move clients through each Stage. They track:
- Completed tasks
- Pending tasks
- What happens next
- When reminders fire

**Next Steps vs. To-Do Lists:**

| Feature | Regular To-Do List | Next Steps in Cloze |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Repeatable** | No—manual every time | Yes—templates for each Segment |
| **Auto-Advance** | No—you pick next task | Yes (Process style) or Manual (Task List style) |
| **Linked to Contacts** | Tasks are separate from people | Every Next Step is attached to a contact |
| **Reminders** | Manual | Automatic based on due dates |
| **Templates** | No | Yes—customize per Segment |

**The Two Styles: Process vs. Task List**

| Style | How It Works | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Process** | Steps advance automatically in order. Mark Step 1 done → Step 2 becomes active. Sequential, enforced order. | Linear workflows where steps must happen in sequence (8x8 program, listing presentation) |
| **Task List** | Mark steps done in any order. Manually pick which step is next. Flexible, non-linear. | Flexible workflows where order varies (buyer showings, ongoing client management) |
| **Mixed** | Some steps auto-advance, some are flexible | Most real-world workflows |

**Key Insight:**

> "Process = 'Do this, then this.' Task List = 'Here's everything. Do in any order.' Use Process for structured workflows (8x8, listing prep), Task List for ongoing relationships (Hot Buyers, Advocates). Why this matters: You've got 40 hours a week. Spend them on what moves the needle, not remembering what comes next."

**HOW Next Steps Appear in Cloze (Video - 2 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

1. Open a contact with active Next Steps
2. Show the Next Steps section on their contact page:
   - ✅ Step 1: Send buyer guide (completed)
   - ✅ Step 2: Schedule consultation (completed)
   - 🔵 Step 3: Review pre-approval (active/current)
   - ⚪ Step 4: Send lender referrals (pending)
   - ⚪ Step 5: Schedule first showing (pending)
3. Show how the current step appears in your Agenda:
   - "Sarah Martinez - Review pre-approval (due today)"
4. Show how to mark a step complete:
   - Tap the checkbox or "Mark Complete"
   - (Process style) Next step automatically becomes active
   - (Task List style) Manually select next step
5. Show the timeline entry when a step completes:
   - "Next Step completed: Review pre-approval"

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What's the difference between Next Steps and Keep in Touch reminders?"
  - A: KIT reminds based on time since last contact. Next Steps are specific workflow tasks. Both appear in Agenda.

- Q: "Can I have multiple Next Step sequences for the same contact?"
  - A: No—one active sequence per contact based on Segment. Change Segment to switch templates.

- Q: "What if I need to skip a step?"
  - A: Mark complete or delete. Process style requires completion to advance.

- Q: "Can I see all active Next Steps across contacts?"
  - A: Yes—Agenda shows all due/overdue. Filter People by active Next Steps.

## MODULE T2: PROCESS STYLE WORKFLOWS

### Sequential Steps That Auto-Advance

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Wants structure | "Process style is perfect when your workflow has a specific order. Step 1 must happen before Step 2. Like the 8x8 program—you can't do Touch 3 before Touch 1." |
| B | Trains new agents | "New agent: 'What do I do next with this lead?' You: 'Just look at Cloze. It tells you.' Process style guides them through your exact system." |
| C | Wants accountability | "Process style won't let you skip steps. If you try to jump to Step 5, it says 'Nope, finish Step 3 first.' Great for making sure nothing gets missed." |

**Story to include:**

> "Hired a new buyer agent. Built our process as a Next Steps template instead of writing instructions. New buyer lead? Cloze tells her: Step 1, Send intro. Step 2, Schedule call. Step 3, Send guide. Mark complete, next step appears automatically. Training done. She was productive day one!"

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**How Process Style Works:**

```
Step 1: Send intro email
   ↓ (mark complete)
Step 2: Schedule buyer consultation
   ↓ (mark complete)
Step 3: Send buyer guide PDF
   ↓ (mark complete)
Step 4: Conduct buyer consultation
   ↓ (mark complete)
Step 5: Review pre-approval
   ↓ (mark complete)
Step 6: Send lender referrals
   ↓ (mark complete)
Step 7: Schedule first showing
```

**When a step is marked complete:**
- That step shows ✅ Completed
- The NEXT step automatically becomes active 🔵
- Reminder fires for the new active step
- You can't skip ahead without marking steps done

**Perfect Use Cases for Process Style:**

| Workflow | Why Process Works |
|----------|------------------|
| **8x8 Program** | 8 touches in 8 weeks, must happen in order |
| **Listing Presentation Prep** | Research → CMA → Presentation → Contract, sequential |
| **New Lead Nurture** | Intro → Guide → Consultation → Qualify, step-by-step |
| **Onboarding Sequence** | Welcome → Setup → Training → Go Live, linear |

**HOW to Create a Process-Style Workflow (Video - 4-5 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

**Example: Buyer Lead Process**

1. Go to More → Settings → People and Companies
2. Find the Segment you want to customize (e.g., "Buyer")
3. Tap the gear icon ⚙️ next to Buyer
4. Select "Next Steps"
5. Choose "Process" style
6. Click "+ Add Step" and create your workflow:

**Step 1: Send intro email** - Immediately, link "Buyer Intro Email"
**Step 2: Schedule consultation** - 1 day after Step 1
**Step 3: Send buyer guide** - When Step 2 complete, link "Buyer Guide Email"
**Step 4: Conduct consultation** - Scheduled date, link "Consultation Agenda"
**Step 5: Review pre-approval** - 1 day after consultation
**Step 6: Send lender referrals** - If needed, link "Lender Referral"
**Step 7: Schedule showing** - 3 days after pre-approval

7. Set reminder timing: Immediately, 1 day after, 3 days after, or specific date
8. Link email templates to steps (if created in Library)
9. Save template
10. Test: Create contact "John Smith," set Segment to "Buyer," Next Steps populate, mark Step 1 complete, Step 2 activates

**Pro Tip:**

> "Link templates to steps. Step 3 says 'Send buyer guide.' Click. Template loads. Edit. Send. Mark complete. Done."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if I need to redo a step?"
  - A: Can't un-complete in Process style. Add a note or create one-off task.

- Q: "What if Steps 3 and 4 can happen in either order?"
  - A: Use Task List or Mixed style. Process enforces strict order.

- Q: "What if buyer doesn't respond and I'm stuck on Step 2?"
  - A: Step stays active until marked complete or contact moved to different Segment.

- Q: "Can I have different sequences for different buyer types?"
  - A: Yes—create Sub-Segments or use tags, build different templates.

- Q: "What if I want some steps auto-advance, others flexible?"
  - A: Use Mixed style—Process for auto-advance, Task List for manual.

## MODULE T3: TASK LIST STYLE WORKFLOWS

### Flexible Checklists, Any Order

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Non-linear workflows | "Your Hot Buyers don't follow a script. Sometimes they want to see homes first, then get pre-approved. Sometimes it's the opposite. Task List style lets you adapt to their pace." |
| B | Wants control | "Process style is too rigid—you want to decide what's next based on the situation. Task List gives you a checklist and lets YOU pick the order." |
| C | Managing ongoing relationships | "Advocates don't have a 'Step 1, Step 2' process. You do VIP touches as opportunities arise. Task List style shows you all the options, you pick what makes sense now." |

**Story to include:**

> "Hot Buyers. Some want to see homes immediately. Others want financing first. Can't force a Process. Task List gives me a menu. Review pre-approval. Send matches. Schedule showings. Check timeline. Mark complete in whatever order fits. Flexible. Nothing forgotten. Perfect."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**How Task List Style Works:**

All steps are visible at once. You can complete them in any order. You manually pick which step is "next" (active).

**Example: Hot Buyer Task List**

- ⚪ Review pre-approval letter
- ⚪ Send property matches based on criteria
- ⚪ Schedule property showings
- ⚪ Follow up after showings
- ⚪ Check in on timeline (how soon are they buying?)
- ⚪ Send market update
- ⚪ Refer to lender (if needed)
- ⚪ Prepare offer when ready

You pick which one to activate first:
- Buyer A: Start with "Review pre-approval"
- Buyer B: Start with "Send property matches" because they're already pre-approved

Mark them complete in whatever order makes sense. Manually select the next active task.

**Task List vs. Process:**

| Scenario | Process | Task List |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **8x8 Program** | ✅ Perfect—must be sequential | ❌ Too rigid |
| **Hot Buyer** | ❌ Every buyer is different | ✅ Perfect—adapt to each buyer |
| **Transaction Checklist** | ✅ Good if milestones are sequential | ✅ Also good—some tasks happen in parallel |
| **Advocate VIP Touches** | ❌ No set order | ✅ Perfect—do what fits the moment |

**Perfect Use Cases for Task List Style:**

| Workflow | Why Task List Works |
|----------|------------------|
| **Hot Buyers** | Buyer pace varies, you adapt to their needs |
| **Active Sellers** | Some want staging, some want repairs, order varies |
| **Advocates** | VIP touches happen opportunistically, not sequentially |
| **Transaction Management** | Some tasks happen in parallel (inspection, appraisal, loan) |

**HOW to Create a Task List Workflow (Video - 4-5 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

**Example: Hot Buyer Task List**

1. Go to More → Settings → People and Companies
2. Find "Buyer" Segment (or create a "Hot Buyer" Sub-Segment)
3. Tap the gear icon ⚙️
4. Select "Next Steps"
5. Choose "Task List" style
6. Click "+ Add Step" and create your checklist:

**Task: Review pre-approval** - Check expiration, verify amount
**Task: Create buyer profile** - Price range, beds, baths, location, features
**Task: Send property matches** - 1 day after profile, link "Property Match Email"
**Task: Schedule showings** - Use scheduler or coordinate manually
**Task: Follow up after showings** - Day after, link "Post-Showing Follow-Up"
**Task: Check in on timeline** - Every 7 days, link "Timeline Check-In"
**Task: Send market update** - Every 14 days, link "Market Update Email"
**Task: Refer to lender** - If needed, link "Lender Referral"
**Task: Prepare offer strategy** - Comps, price, terms, contingencies

7. Save template
8. Test: Create "Emily Johnson," set to Buyer/Hot, Task List appears, select "Review pre-approval," mark complete, select next based on situation

**Pro Tip:**

> "Use Task List when order depends on client. Your process menu. Everything listed. You pick what fits. Adapt to their pace. Win every time."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if I want tasks to auto-remind without marking active?"
  - A: Set recurring reminders on individual tasks. Fire even if not currently active.

- Q: "What if I complete all tasks but keep client in this Segment?"
  - A: Fine—completed tasks stay completed. Add new tasks or reset checklist.

- Q: "Can I re-order tasks after creating them?"
  - A: Yes—drag and drop in Next Steps settings. Order affects display only.

- Q: "What if some tasks are required, others optional?"
  - A: Use Mixed style or labels in task names for priority.

- Q: "What if I want to skip irrelevant tasks?"
  - A: Don't activate them. Manually pick what's next.

## MODULE T5: LINKING TEMPLATES TO NEXT STEPS

### Automate Your Best Emails

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Wastes time rewriting emails | "You've sent the same buyer guide email 50 times. Why are you rewriting it each time? Link a template to that Next Step and it auto-loads when you need it." |
| B | Inconsistent messaging | "Sometimes your intro email is great. Sometimes you're rushing and it's mediocre. Templates ensure every client gets your A-game message, every time." |
| C | Wants faster execution | "Linking templates to Next Steps means one click loads your pre-written, proven email. Edit if needed, send. What took 5 minutes now takes 30 seconds." |

**Story to include:**

> "Created 10 templates for my buyer process. Intro. Guide. Lender referrals. Matches. Offer prep. Follow-up. Linked each to its Next Step. Cloze reminds me 'Send buyer guide to Sarah.' I click. Template loads. Personalize one sentence. Send. Sent it 100 times. Still sounds fresh. The result: Every buyer gets my A-game message, even when I'm exhausted."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**How Template Linking Works:**

```
NEXT STEP:
"Send buyer guide PDF"
   ↓
LINKED TEMPLATE:
"Buyer Guide Email"
   ↓
ONE CLICK:
Template loads in email composer

YOU:
Personalize, send, mark step complete
```

**Templates You Can Link:**

| **Marketing Email** | Designed newsletters | Market update, listing announcement |
| **Text Message** | SMS templates | Quick check-in, showing confirmation |
| **Call Script** | Phone call talking points | Buyer consultation agenda, listing pitch |

**Creating Templates in the Library:**

Templates live in More → Library. Create them once, link to multiple Next Steps.

**Example Template: Buyer Guide Email**

```
Subject: Your Homebuyer Guide

Hi [First Name],

## MODULE T6: RECURRING TASKS & REMINDERS

### Automate Your Regular Check-Ins and Routines

**WHY (Video - 3-4 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Forgets regular tasks | "You plan to call your top 20 past clients quarterly. By month 3, you've forgotten. Recurring tasks ensure it happens automatically every 90 days." |
| B | Overwhelmed by manual scheduling | "You're manually creating 'Call Sarah in 30 days' every single month for every client. Recurring tasks do this once, repeat forever." |
| C | Wants consistent touchpoints | "Your Advocates get inconsistent outreach—sometimes monthly, sometimes you forget for 3 months. Recurring tasks create consistent rhythm." |

**Story to include:**

> "Wanted to call top 10 Advocates quarterly. Create task, complete, forget to schedule next one. Realize 6 months passed. Oops. Set up recurring task: 'Call Top Advocates' every 90 days. Day 90 arrives. Task appears. Call them. Mark complete. Auto-schedules for 90 days later. Perfect consistency, zero manual work. Never miss a quarter again!"

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**What Are Recurring Tasks?**

Recurring tasks are **Next Steps that automatically repeat** on a schedule you define (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly).

**Recurring vs. One-Time Tasks:**

| Feature | One-Time Task | Recurring Task |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Frequency** | Happens once | Repeats automatically |
| **Setup** | Create each time | Create once, repeats forever |
| **Use Case** | Specific deadline or milestone | Regular routines, check-ins |
| **Examples** | "Send offer by Friday" | "Monthly newsletter," "Quarterly call" |

**Common Recurring Tasks for Real Estate:**

| Task | Frequency | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Call Top 10 Advocates** | Every 90 days | Quarterly referral ask |
| **Send monthly market update** | 1st of each month | Newsletter to database |
| **Review Active Buyers** | Every Monday | Weekly pipeline check |
| **8x8 Touch** | Every 7 days (8 times) | Ninja Selling 8x8 program |
| **Annual Past Client Check-In** | Yearly (on home anniversary) | Retention and referrals |
| **Quarterly Business Review** | Every 90 days | Personal goals/metrics |
| **Weekly Prospecting Block** | Every Tuesday 9 AM | Lead generation time |

**How Recurring Tasks Work:**

```
CREATE RECURRING TASK:
"Call Top Advocates" - Repeat every 90 days
   ↓
FIRST OCCURRENCE:
Task appears in Agenda on Day 1
   ↓
YOU COMPLETE IT:
Mark task complete
   ↓
AUTO-RESCHEDULE:
Task automatically appears 90 days later
   ↓
REPEAT FOREVER:
Every 90 days, task appears → you complete → auto-reschedules
```

3. Due: 90 days from now
4. Repeat: Every 90 days
5. Save
6. Every 90 days, this task appears for Sarah automatically

**Part 3: Recurring Task for Segments**

**Example: Monthly Newsletter to All Past Clients**

1. Create recurring task: "Send monthly newsletter"
2. Due: 1st of each month
3. Assign to: Yourself (not a specific contact)
4. Linked to: Past Client Audience (optional)
5. Repeat: Monthly
6. Save
7. Every month on the 1st, reminder appears to send newsletter

**Part 4: Recurring Task with Template Link**

**Example: 8x8 Touch Sequence (Weekly for 8 Weeks)**

1. Create recurring task: "8x8 Touch #1"
2. Due: Today (when Segment is set to 8x8)
3. Link template: "8x8 Touch 1 Email"
4. Repeat: Every 7 days
5. Stop after: 8 occurrences
6. Save

Now:
- Week 1: "8x8 Touch #1" appears → Complete
- Week 2: "8x8 Touch #2" appears → Complete
- ... continues for 8 weeks, then stops

**Part 5: Advanced Recurring Options**

**Custom Intervals:**

- Every 3 days
- Every 2 weeks
- Every 6 months
- 1st and 15th of each month (create two recurring tasks)

**Conditional Recurrence:**

- "Repeat until contact moves to Seller stage"
- "Repeat for 6 months, then stop"
- "Repeat only on weekdays" (Monday-Friday)

**Pause and Resume:**

- Pause a recurring task temporarily (e.g., client goes on vacation)
- Resume when ready

**Part 6: Managing Recurring Tasks**

1. View all recurring tasks: Agenda → Filter: "Recurring"
2. Edit recurrence: Open task → Change frequency
3. Skip one occurrence: Mark complete without doing it, or delete that instance
4. Stop recurrence: Edit task → Disable "Repeat"
5. Delete series: Delete the task + choose "Delete all future occurrences"

**Pro Tip:**

> "Use recurring tasks for scheduled activities. Monday prospecting. Quarterly Advocate calls. Monthly newsletter. All recurring. Set it once. Cloze remembers so you don't have to. Perfect consistency on autopilot."

**WHAT IF (Text)**

- Q: "What if I want to reschedule one occurrence without changing the series?"
  - A: Edit due date for that instance only. Doesn't affect future repeats.

- Q: "What if I complete a recurring task early?"
  - A: Mark complete anytime. Next occurrence schedules based on original frequency.

- Q: "Can contacts have different recurring tasks?"
  - A: Yes—Sarah gets quarterly calls, Mike gets monthly.

- Q: "What if I want tasks on specific days (1st and 15th)?"
  - A: Create two separate recurring tasks.

- Q: "Can I see past completions history?"
  - A: Yes—timeline or activity history shows all completed instances.

- Q: "What if I want to pause a recurring task temporarily?"
  - A: Delete current instance or disable recurrence temporarily.

- Q: "Can I assign recurring tasks to team members?"
  - A: Yes—set recurrence and assign. Appears in their Agenda on schedule.

- Q: "What's the difference between recurring tasks and KIT reminders?"
  - A: KIT is relationship-based (time since last contact). Recurring tasks are action-based (specific schedule).
