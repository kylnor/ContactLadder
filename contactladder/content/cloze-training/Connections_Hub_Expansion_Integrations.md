## INTEGRATION 8: ZILLOW

### Capture Zillow Leads Directly in Cloze

**WHY (Video - 1-2 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Paying for Zillow | "You're paying Zillow for leads. They email you, you manually enter them in Cloze. That's double work and slow response time. Integrate them. Leads appear in Cloze instantly." |
| B | Frustrated by lead loss | "Zillow lead comes in at 9pm. You see it at 10am next day. They've already called 3 other agents. Auto-sync means you get alerted immediately." |
| C | High-volume lead buyers | "If you're getting 20+ Zillow leads per month, manual entry is killing your response time. Integrate and get back 10 hours/month." |

**Story to include:**

> "Lost $15K commission. Saw Zillow lead 6hrs late. After integration: instant notification, first response. Conversion tripled. That's $45K in new revenue from one integration!"

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

### What the Zillow Integration Does

**Automatic Lead Capture:**
- Zillow leads appear in Cloze as new contacts
- All Zillow data auto-populates (name, email, phone, property interest, message)
- Tagged automatically with #zillow
- Triggers Cloze alerts

**Data Synced from Zillow:**

| Field | What It Captures | Where It Goes in Cloze |
|-------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Name** | Buyer's name | Contact name |
| **Email** | Contact email | Email field |
| **Phone** | Contact phone | Phone field |
| **Property Interest** | What property they inquired about | Notes or custom field |
| **Message** | Their inquiry message | Timeline note |
| **Lead Date** | When inquiry came in | Date added |

**Benefits:** Instant alerts, no manual entry, complete history, faster response

**Why this matters:** You're paying Zillow hundreds per month. Speed is everything. First agent to respond gets the deal. Integration means you respond in 5 minutes, not 5 hours. The result: 3x conversion rate. More closings. Better ROI on your Zillow spend!

**Requirements:**
- Zillow Premier Agent account
- Cloze Business plan or higher
- Integration setup (one-time)

## INTEGRATION 9: DOTLOOP (DETAILED)

### Transaction Management Integration

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Uses dotloop, not connected | "You're uploading documents to dotloop, then manually updating Cloze. Two systems, double work. Connect them. Transaction status auto-updates in Cloze." |
| B | Frustrated by transaction chaos | "Where's that inspection report? Which dotloop loop is this client in? Integrate dotloop and Cloze shows all transaction docs in the contact's timeline." |
| C | Team coordination | "Your TC uses dotloop, you use Cloze. You're constantly asking 'Did they sign?' Connect them. Real-time transaction visibility for everyone." |

**Story to include:**

> "6 transactions in dotloop. Manual updates impossible. After integration: signatures auto-log in Cloze. Everything synced. No app switching. Zero double-entry!"

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

### What the dotloop Integration Does

**Bi-Directional Sync:**

| Direction | What Syncs | Why It Matters |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Cloze → dotloop** | Contact info, buyer/seller details | Pre-fill dotloop profiles from Cloze contacts |
| **dotloop → Cloze** | Loop creation, document uploads, signatures, status changes | See transaction progress in Cloze timeline |

**Data Synced from dotloop:**

| Event | What Appears in Cloze | When |
|-------|----------------------|------|
| **Loop created** | "Transaction started: 123 Maple St" | Immediately |
| **Document uploaded** | "Offer uploaded to dotloop" | When TC/agent adds it |
| **Signature requested** | "Signature requested from buyer" | When sent |
| **Document signed** | "Contract signed by all parties" | When complete |
| **Status changed** | "Transaction status: Under Contract" | Real-time |
| **Loop closed** | "Transaction closed successfully" | At closing |

**Benefits:**
- **Timeline visibility** - All transaction milestones in contact record
- **Team collaboration** - TC, agent, and team see same data
- **Client communication** - Know transaction status before calling client
- **Compliance** - Transaction history preserved in Cloze

**The result:** No more "Where's that contract?" panic. No more asking your TC for status updates. No more looking like you don't know what's happening when a client calls. Just instant visibility into every deal!

- A: Work with TC to grant you viewer access, or have TC manually update Cloze when key milestones happen.

**Q: "Do dotloop documents attach to Cloze?"**

**Q: "Can I see ALL my transactions in one Cloze view?"**

| A | Uses SkySlope | "SkySlope tracks your compliance checklist. Cloze tracks your relationships. Connect them and you see transaction progress without leaving Cloze." |

| B | High open house volume | "If you do 2+ open houses per month, manual entry wastes hours. Spacio + Cloze = instant lead capture and automated follow-up." |

## PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

### Integration Strategy for Real Estate Agents

**Recommended Integration Stack:**

| Tool | Purpose | Priority | When to Integrate |
|------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Email** | Communication | Required | Day 1 |
| **Phone** | Call/text tracking | Required | Day 1 |
| **Calendar** | Meeting tracking | Required | Day 1 |
| **ActivePipe** | Email marketing at scale | High | Month 1 |
| **RealScout** | Buyer property matching | High | Month 1 |
| **Zillow** | Lead capture | High | If using Zillow |
| **Spacio** | Open house leads | Medium | If doing open houses |
| **dotloop/SkySlope** | Transaction management | Medium | When you have transactions |
| **Canva** | Marketing materials with MAIA | Medium | Month 2 |
| **DocuSign** | E-signatures | Low | As needed |

**Integration Workflow:**

**Week 1-2: Core Connections**
1. Email, Phone, Calendar (Essentials Module 0)
2. Test all three, verify sync working
3. Enable Ninja Selling view

**Month 1: Lead Flow**
4. Zillow (if using) - capture leads instantly
5. ActivePipe - marketing automation
6. RealScout - buyer matching

**Month 2: Transaction Tools**
7. dotloop or SkySlope - when first deal goes under contract
8. Spacio - before next open house

**Month 3: Polish**
9. Canva - for MAIA-generated flyers
10. Additional tools as needed

**Maintenance:**

**Monthly:** Check connections, verify sync, resolve errors, review new integrations

**Quarterly:** Assess tool usage, disconnect unused, calculate ROI

**Why this matters:** Every integration saves time. But unused integrations create clutter. Review quarterly. Keep what works. Cut what doesn't. Your tech stack should make you faster, not slower!
