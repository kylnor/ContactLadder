# MINI-MODULE: NOTES & ACTIVITY LOGGING

## howtoCloze.com / contactladder.com

---

## OVERVIEW

**Goal:** Master the art of capturing every client conversation, showing, and interaction so you never forget important details.

**Who This Is For:** All agents who need to track conversations, log activities, and maintain detailed records.

**Time to Complete:** 15-20 minutes

**Prerequisites:**
- Completed Essentials Modules 1-4
- Email/Phone/Calendar connected

**The Promise:**

> "Can't remember 50 client conversations? Cloze can. Notes equal searchable memory. Why this matters: You talk to 30 people a week. When Sarah calls six months later asking about that house with the pool, you'll know exactly which one. Your clients think you're a genius. You just took good notes."

---

## SECTION 1: WHY NOTES MATTER

### Your Memory, Amplified

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Forgets details | "You talk to 30 people a week. When Sarah calls six months later asking about that house with the pool, can you remember which one? Notes can." |
| B | Takes notes elsewhere | "You're scribbling on sticky notes, using your phone's Notes app, keeping a notebook. Then 't find anything. Put it all in Cloze where it lives with the contact." |
| C | Doesn't take notes | "Your memory is great until it isn't. One missed detail—forgetting a client's timeline or budget—costs you deals. Notes take 10 seconds and save your reputation." |

**Story to include:**

> "Showed 12 houses. Two months later: 'Remember that backyard?' Pulled up notes: 'Maple Street, RV parking, mature trees.' Stunned I remembered. Notes did. Closed 3 weeks later."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

### Types of Activities You Should Log

| Activity Type | Examples | Why Log It |
|--------------|----------|-----------|
| **Phone Calls** | Buyer consultation, seller CMA review, lender call | Capture what was discussed, next steps, concerns |
| **In-Person Meetings** | Coffee, showings, listing appointments | Remember preferences, family details, decision factors |
| **Showings** | Property tours, open houses | Track which houses they liked/disliked and why |
| **Text Conversations** | Quick check-ins, scheduling | Document important details buried in casual texts |
| **Important Emails** | Offer details, contract questions | Highlight key points for quick reference |
| **Client Milestones** | Anniversary of closing, moved in, referral sent | Build relationship history |

**Capture:** Key points, action items, personal details, property feedback, objections, next steps

**Key Insight:** Notes aren't just for you. They're for your team, your assistant, and proving you actually listen. Why this matters: One missed detail costs you deals. One forgotten preference loses trust. 10 seconds per note saves your reputation.

## SECTION 3: LOGGING ACTIVITIES

### Track Everything That Happens

**HOW (Video - 3-4 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

### Logging Activities Automatically

**What Cloze Tracks Automatically (when connected):**

| Activity | How It's Tracked | Where It Shows |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Emails** | Via email sync | Timeline - shows sent/received, subject, date |
| **Phone Calls** | Via phone sync | Timeline - shows call duration, direction (in/out) |
| **Text Messages** | Via phone sync | Timeline - shows texts sent/received |
| **Calendar Meetings** | Via calendar sync | Timeline - shows meeting title, date, time |

**You don't need to log these manually—Cloze does it for you!**

### Logging Activities Manually

**When to Log Manually:**

- In-person meetings (coffee, showings, open houses)
- Activities that happened outside Cloze tracking (used a different phone, met in person)
- Important milestones (contract signed, closing completed, moved in)

**How to Log:**

1. **Open the contact**
2. **Click "+ Add Activity"** (or use Add Note with activity type)
3. **Choose activity type:**
   - Meeting
   - Note
   - Task
   - Phone Call
   - Other
4. **Fill in details:**
   - Date (if not today)
   - Time (if relevant)
   - Description
5. **Save**

### Logging Showings (Best Practice)

**Template for Showing Notes:**

```
Property: 123 Maple Street, Henderson
Feedback: Loved the kitchen and backyard. Too small - wants 4BR minimum.
Concerns: HOA fees too high, no RV parking
Next Steps: Send 4BR listings in Henderson with lower HOA
Timeline: Following up Friday 1/20
```

**Quick Version (On Mobile):**

```
123 Maple - loved kitchen, too small, wants 4BR, follow up Friday with new listings
```

**Result:** Six months from now when they ask "which house had the great kitchen?" you know exactly which one.

## SECTION 4: EVERNOTE & ONENOTE INTEGRATION

### Powerful Note-Taking for Power Users

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

**Hook:** "Built-in notes are great for quick captures. But if you want formatted notes, checklists, images, and powerful search, integrate Evernote or OneNote. The result: Notes on steroids. Everything searchable. Everything organized. Everything in one place!"

## SECTION 5: BEST PRACTICES

### Making Notes Work for You

**Note-Taking Strategies:**

### 1. The "Right After" Rule

**Capture notes immediately after activities**
- Right after a showing: 30-second voice note
- Right after a call: 1-minute typed note
- Right after a meeting: 2-minute summary

**Why:** Details fade fast. "I'll remember later" equals you won't. Period.

### 2. The Template Approach

**Create templates for common scenarios:**

**Buyer Consultation Template:**
```
Budget:
Down payment:
Pre-approval: Yes/No - Lender:
Must-haves:
Nice-to-haves:
Timeline:
Decision makers:
Concerns:
Next steps:
```

**Showing Feedback Template:**
```
Property: [Address]
Liked:
Disliked:
Questions:
Interest level (1-10):
Next steps:
```

**Save these in your phone's Notes app or Evernote, copy/paste into Cloze**

### 3. The FORD Method

**Capture personal details using FORD:**
- **F**amily - Spouse, kids, pets
- **O**ccupation - Where they work, what they do
- **R**ecreation - Hobbies, interests
- **D**reams - Goals, aspirations

**Example Note:**
```
Coffee with Mike Thompson. Family: wife Christine, 2 kids (Emma 8, Jake 12). Works at Switch as IT manager. Loves RVing - planning Alaska trip next summer. Dream: Retire early and travel full-time.
```

**Result:** Next time you talk, you ask about Alaska trip planning. Mike thinks you actually care (you do) and remember everything (Cloze helps). Boom. Instant connection!

### 4. Tag Everything

**Use hashtags in notes for easy filtering:**
- #showing - all showing notes
- #consultation - buyer/seller consultations
- #concern - objections or worries
- #urgent - needs immediate follow-up
- #referral - referred someone to you

**Example:**
```
#showing 123 Maple St - loved kitchen, too small #concern about HOA fees #urgent follow up Friday with 4BR options
```

**Later:** Search for #concern to see all client concerns across all contacts

### 5. Set Reminders from Notes

**Turn notes into action:**
- After noting a concern → Set reminder to address it
- After showing feedback → Set reminder to send new listings
- After consultation → Set reminder for 3-day follow-up

**Example:**
1. Add note: "Needs to discuss offer with wife this weekend"
2. Set reminder: "Monday 9am: Follow up on offer discussion"

## SECTION 6: MOBILE NOTE-TAKING MASTERY

### Capture On the Go

**Mobile Workflows:**

### Quick Voice Note Workflow (30 seconds)

**Scenario:** Just left a showing, driving to next appointment

1. **Pull over safely** (or use voice while parked)
2. **Open Cloze app**
3. **Find contact**
4. **Tap +** → **Add Note** → **Microphone**
5. **Speak:** "Just showed 456 Oak Ave. She loved the layout and finishes. Concerned about distance to work - 30 min commute. Wants something closer to Summerlin. Sending new listings tomorrow morning."
6. **Tap Save**
7. **Done** - drive to next appointment

### Photo Note Workflow

**Scenario:** At a showing, want to remember specific details

1. **Take photos with phone camera** (of features client liked/disliked)
2. **Open Cloze**
3. **Add Note**
4. **Attach photos**
5. **Add caption:** "Kitchen and backyard - client favorites"
6. **Save**

**Result:** Visual memory aid attached to contact

### Text-to-Note Workflow

**Scenario:** Client texts important info

**Option 1 - Manual:**
1. **Copy the important text**
2. **Open Cloze**
3. **Add Note**
4. **Paste text**
5. **Add context:** "Client texted: budget increased to $550K, wants to move faster"

**Option 2 - Automatic:**
- If texts are synced, they appear on timeline automatically
- Just add a note flagging it as important: "Budget increased - see text from 1/15"
