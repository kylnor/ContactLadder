## SECTION 2: NOTIFICATIONS

### Control What Alerts You Get (and When)

**WHY This Matters:**

> "Customize notifications. Stay informed without getting buried. Why this matters: You've got 40 hours a week. Spend them working deals, not drowning in alerts for every single email."

**Notification Types:**

| Type | What It Does | Default | Recommended |
|------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Next Step Reminders** | Alerts when tasks are due | On (push + email) | Keep ON |
| **Email Replies** | Notifies when someone replies to your email | On | OFF (check inbox naturally) |
| **New Emails** | Alerts for every new email | On | OFF (too noisy) |
| **Meeting Reminders** | Alerts before calendar events | On | Keep ON (15 min before) |
| **Smart Suggestions** | AI alerts for stale contacts, follow-ups | On | Keep ON |
| **Keep in Touch Reminders** | Alerts when KIT window closing | On | Keep ON |
| **Digest Emails** | Daily or weekly summary of activity | On | Keep ON (choose frequency) |

**How to Configure Notifications:**

1. Go to More → Settings → Notifications
2. Toggle each notification type on/off
3. Choose delivery method:
   - **Push notifications** (mobile app)
   - **Email notifications**
   - **Text notifications** (SMS, premium feature)
4. Set notification frequency:
   - **Instant:** Immediate alerts
   - **Batched:** Grouped alerts every X hours
   - **Daily digest:** One summary per day
   - **Weekly digest:** One summary per week
5. Save changes

**Recommended Setup:**

✅ **ON:** Next Steps, Smart Suggestions, Keep in Touch, meetings, daily digest
❌ **OFF:** New email, reply alerts, social media

**Quiet Hours (Do Not Disturb):**

1. Settings → Notifications → Quiet Hours
2. Enable Quiet Hours
3. Set times: 9 PM - 7 AM (customize to your schedule)
4. During quiet hours:
   - No push notifications
   - No email alerts (unless marked urgent)
   - Reminders still appear in-app but don't sound/vibrate
5. Save

**Pro Tip:** Turn OFF new email alerts. Save notifications for tasks and follow-ups you might forget.

---

## SECTION 3: WORK HOURS & SCHEDULE

### Set Your Availability and Optimize Timing

**WHY This Matters:**

> "Cloze can schedule follow-ups, send emails, and set reminders. But if you work 9-5 and Cloze suggests calling someone at 8 PM, that's a problem. Set your work hours so Cloze respects your schedule. The result: No more reminders when you're off the clock. No more missed opportunities because the timing was wrong."

**Work Hours Settings:**

1. Go to Settings → Work Hours
2. Set your typical work schedule:
   - Monday - Friday: 9 AM - 6 PM
   - Saturday: 10 AM - 2 PM
   - Sunday: OFF
3. Cloze will:
   - Suggest Next Steps during work hours
   - Avoid scheduling reminders outside work hours
   - Time email sends for optimal engagement

**Time Zone:**

1. Settings → Account → Time Zone
2. Select your local time zone
3. All timestamps, reminders, and scheduling will use this time zone

**Email Send Time Optimization:**

Cloze can delay email sends to optimize open rates:

1. Settings → Email Settings → Send Time Optimization
2. Enable "Optimize send times"
3. Cloze analyzes recipient behavior and sends emails when they're most likely to open
4. Example: You draft an email at 11 PM, Cloze sends it at 9 AM the next day when recipient typically checks email

**Pro Tip:**

> "If you work evenings or weekends, update your work hours to reflect that. Cloze will schedule reminders during your actual work times, not the default 9-5. Your calendar. Your rules!"

---

## SECTION 4: EMAIL SETTINGS

### Signatures, Tracking, and Sync

   ```

   [Email]
   [Website]
   ```
3. Add logo or photo (optional)
4. Choose when to include signature:
   - New emails only
   - Replies and forwards
   - Always
