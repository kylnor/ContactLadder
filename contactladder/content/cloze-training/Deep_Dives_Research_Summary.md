## RECOMMENDED APPROACH

Based on the research, I recommend creating each Deep Dive as a separate MD file following the same structure as Advanced and Essentials:

**Each Deep Dive Should Include:**
- WHY section (2-3 audience versions)
- WHAT section (features, capabilities, use cases)
- HOW section (step-by-step workflows with video notes)
- WHAT IF section (FAQs and troubleshooting)
- Links to relevant help.cloze.com articles
- Real-world stories and examples
- Completion certificate showing what they learned

**Suggested Priority Order:**
1. **Templates & Campaigns** - Most agents need this immediately after Advanced
2. **Cloze AI Mastery** - Maximizes the MAIA features learned in Advanced A4
3. **Task Lists** - Customizes workflows for buyer/seller processes
4. **Properties** - For agents actively tracking transactions
5. **Teams** - For team leads and growing operations
6. **Marketing Newsletters** - For agents doing their own marketing vs using ActivePipe

---

## NEXT STEPS

Which Deep Dive would you like me to create first? Or should I create all 6?

Each will be approximately:
- 15-25 pages of content
- 4-6 main sections per topic
- Multiple workflows and examples
- Complete help article references
- Video recording notes for HOW sections
