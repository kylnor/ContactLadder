## MODULE M1: MOBILE VS DESKTOP - KNOW THE DIFFERENCES

### Understanding the Mobile Experience

**WHY (Video - 2-3 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Rarely uses mobile | "You check Cloze on your computer once a day. But your buyers text you at 8pm. Listings hit MLS during lunch. Clients call while you're driving. Mobile Cloze means you're always ready." |
| B | Uses mobile, frustrated | "Mobile Cloze isn't just 'desktop but smaller.' Some features work differently, some are mobile-only. Understanding the differences prevents frustration." |
| C | Mobile-first agent | "You live on your phone. Good. Cloze mobile is built for you. But there are desktop-only features you should know about for when you get back to the office." |

**Story to include:**

> "At showing. Buyer texted: 'Approved $50K more. Bigger houses?' Updated budget in Cloze. Sent 5 listings before he left the bank. Closed 3 weeks later."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

### Feature Comparison: Mobile vs Desktop

| Feature | Mobile | Desktop | Notes |
|---------|--------|---------|-------|
| **View Contacts** | ✅ Full access | ✅ Full access | Same everywhere |
| **Agenda** | ✅ Full access | ✅ Full access | Same everywhere |
| **Add Notes** | ✅ Voice & text | ✅ Text only | Mobile has voice notes |
| **Email Composing** | ✅ Limited formatting | ✅ Full formatting | Desktop better for long emails |
| **MAIA** | ✅ Voice-first | ✅ Text-first | Mobile optimized for voice |
| **Audiences** | ✅ View & create | ✅ View & create | Both work great |
| **Mail Merge** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Desktop easier for large merges |
| **Bulk Editing** | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Full power | Use desktop for bulk changes |
| **Custom Fields** | ✅ View & edit | ✅ View & edit | Same on both |
| **Settings** | ⚠️ Basic only | ✅ Full settings | Complex setup needs desktop |
| **Import/Export** | ❌ Desktop only | ✅ Yes | Can't import from mobile |
| **Widgets** | ✅ iOS/Android widgets | ❌ N/A | Mobile exclusive |
| **Offline Mode** | ✅ Limited | ⚠️ Requires connection | Mobile caches data |
| **Call/Text Logging** | ✅ Automatic | ⚠️ Manual only | Mobile tracks phone activity |

**Mobile:** Voice notes/commands, automatic tracking, quick captures, widgets, camera, location features

**Desktop:** Bulk editing, complex audiences, reporting, multi-window work, long emails, settings

**Key Insight:**

> "Mobile is for CAPTURING and RESPONDING. Desktop is for ORGANIZING and ANALYZING. Use both strategically. Why this matters: You've got 40 hours a week. 30 of them are in the field. Mobile Cloze means those 30 hours are just as productive as your 10 desk hours!"
