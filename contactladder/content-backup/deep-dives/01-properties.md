# CLOZE DEEP DIVE: PROPERTIES

## DEEP DIVE OVERVIEW

**Goal:** Master Cloze Properties to track listings, match buyers to properties, and manage transactions from listing to close.

**Who This Is For:** Agents who want to use Cloze as their primary transaction and listing management system.

**Prerequisites:**
- Completed Cloze Essentials (or actively using Segments, Stages, and Agenda)
- Cloze Business Platinum Plan
- Brokerage licensing agreement for MLS integration (contact support@cloze.com)

**Time to Complete:** 45-60 minutes

## MODULE P1: PROPERTIES OVERVIEW

### Why Track Properties in Cloze?

**WHY (Video - 3-4 min)**

| Version | Audience | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| A | Uses separate MLS/transaction tools | "You're searching properties in your MLS, tracking buyers in Cloze, and managing deals in a spreadsheet. Three systems for one job. Properties consolidates it all into Cloze." |
| B | Manually matching buyers to listings | "You've got a new listing. Now you're scrolling through your buyer list thinking 'who wanted 4 bedrooms in Summerlin?' Let Cloze's matching engine find them for you in 5 seconds." |
| C | Wants better transaction tracking | "From the day you list a property to the day it closes, Properties tracks every step—offers, contingencies, inspections, close date—all linked to the buyer, seller, and other agents. One timeline, complete story." |

**Story to include:**

> "I used to keep a spreadsheet of my buyer preferences—price range, bedrooms, neighborhoods, all hand-typed. When I got a new listing, I'd scan the spreadsheet, email 5-10 people individually, and hope I remembered everyone. With Properties, I add the listing once, Cloze shows me every matching buyer instantly, and I send a curated property alert to all of them in one click. What took 30 minutes now takes 2."

**WHAT (Text + Visual)**

**Properties Has Three Main Functions:**

| Function | What It Does | Who Uses It |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Search MLS** | Search your entire local MLS from within Cloze | All agents with MLS access |
| **Match Buyers to Properties** | Build buyer profiles, auto-match to listings | Buyer agents |
| **Track Transactions** | Create deals, link contacts, manage timeline | Listing and buyer agents |

**The Complete Workflow:**

```
BUYER SIDE:
1. Create buyer profile with preferences
   ↓
2. Cloze auto-matches to MLS listings
   ↓
3. Curate and send property alerts
   ↓
4. Track buyer engagement (opens, clicks)
   ↓
5. Create transaction when offer accepted
   ↓
6. Track through close

LISTING SIDE:
1. Add your listing to Cloze
   ↓
2. Cloze finds matching buyers in your database
   ↓
3. Send listing alerts to interested buyers
   ↓
4. Create transaction when offer accepted
   ↓
5. Track through close
```

**Key Insight:**

> "The matching engine works both ways. Buyers match TO listings (what's new on the market for them?). Listings match TO buyers (who in my database wants this?). Both save you hours of manual work."

**Requirements:**

- Cloze Business Platinum Plan
- MLS integration through your brokerage (contact support@cloze.com for setup)
- Supports all major MLS standards

**HOW to Access Properties (Video - 1 min)**

*Screen recording showing:*

1. Open Cloze (web or mobile)
